              "      <td>The author introduced this muscle for the first time almost a decade ago, and this is the first extensive description of the intricate microanatomy of this complex but unique microneurovascular muscle unit. Advantages and disadvantages and indications and contraindications for its use in facial paralysis are presented in detail from an extensive clinical experience of almost 50 such microneurovascular transfers. Pitfalls that the reconstructive microsurgeon should beware and strengths in using this muscle for facial palsy are highlighted. The detailed operative approach is presented, with promise of undetectable scars and minimal functional loss. The strategies for how to inset this muscle unit in the new recipient site are given, along with the thought processes involved in selecting the actual sites of anchoring the muscle to reproduce a mirror image of the contralateral normal face. Finally, an exemplary clinical case demonstrating the use of the pectoralis minor muscle for both eye and lower face reanimation is presented in detail, demonstrating the dual nerve supply and the resulting independent eye and smile movements with total lack of mass action and/or synkinesis. Restorations of eye blink and of a symmetrical and coordinated smile are the frequent rewards of using this unique muscle for the correction of facial palsy.</td>\n",

              "      <td>This paper reports our experience in facial reanimation using free innervated muscle transfer in 69 patients with long-term facial palsy. The majority of patients were treated in two stages with cross-facial nerve graft as the first stage and microvascular muscle transfer at the second stage. The gracilis muscle was used in 62 patients. A system of grading results has been utilized in the long-term evaluation. The overall final result was excellent or good in 51 percent of 47 patients who were available for follow-up. Although the results are not completely satisfactory, they justify the use of this approach to a difficult clinical problem. The results are improving as technical modifications to the procedure have evolved. The gracilis muscle is a reliable free transfer with internal anatomy conductive to use for reanimation of the paralyzed face. This type of transfer, in our experience, has proved superior to nonmicrosurgical methods for treatment of complete and severe incomplete facial palsy. The seventh cranial nerve is used in the innervation of the transferred muscle, the ipsilateral being preferable if available. The authors believe that use of the same cranial nerve is superior to methods that involve other cranial nerves, where spontaneity is often not achieved.</td>\n",

The nerve and muscle grafts can be performed by microneurovascular anastomosis in one surgical procedure. The follow-up period was over 1 year.

              "      <td>OBJECTIVE: Although the rate of reported facial nerve preservation after surgery for vestibular schwannomas continuously increases, facial nerve paresis or paralysis is a frequent postsurgical sequelae of major concern. The major goal of this study was to define criteria for the right indication, timing, and type of therapy for patients with palsies despite anatomic nerve continuity and those with loss of anatomic continuity. METHODS: One thousand vestibular schwannomas were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery at Nordstadt Hospital from 1978 to 1993. Of 979 cases of complete removal and 21 cases of deliberately partial removal, the facial nerve was anatomically preserved in 929 cases (93%). The rate of preservation is increasing, as is evidenced in the most recent cases, and preservation is supported by special electrophysiological monitoring. The facial nerve was anatomically severed in 60 cases (6%). It was anatomically lost in previous operations that were performed elsewhere in 11 cases (1%). In case of nerve discontinuity (42 cases), immediate nerve reconstruction by one of three available intracranial procedures (within the cerebellopontine angle, intracranial-intratemporal, intracranial-extracranial) was performed in the same surgical setting. In case of loss of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem, early reanimation by combination with the hypoglossal nerve was achieved in most patients within weeks after tumor surgery. In a few patients with anatomic nerve continuity but absence of reinnervation for 10 to 12 months, a hypoglossal-facial combination was applied. All the patients with partial or with complete palsies were treated in a special follow-up program of regular controls and of modulation of physiotherapeutic treatment every 3 to 6 months. RESULTS: In intracranial nerve reconstruction at the cerebellopontine angle, 61 to 70% of patients regained complete eye closure and an overall result equivalent to House-Brackmann Grade 3. Hypoglossal- facial reanimation led to Grade 3 in 79%. The duration between the onset of paralysis and the reconstructive procedure is decisive for the quality of the outcome. These data are discussed in view of other treatment options and certain parameters influencing outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This management contains three major principles as follows: 1) preservation of facial nerve continuity in function by the aid of intraoperative monitoring, 2) early nerve reconstruction in case of lost continuity, and 3) scheduled follow-up program for all patients with incomplete or complete palsies.</td>\n",

As a result the diagnosis of facial paralysis may be delayed. The aim of this study is to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of facial paralysis in such cases. Between 1990 and 1996, sixteen patients with facial paralysis due to temporal bone fracture were operated on within one month of trauma. The surgical technique was selected on the basis of the location of fallopian canal involvement and the patients hearing status. Six patients had grade VI, 7 had grade V and 3 had grade IV facial weakness preoperatively. Twelve patients had serviceable hearing. 9 of them underwent facial decompression through the transmastoid approach and 3 were operated on via the middle fossa approach. Four patients with unserviceable hearing had the operation through the translabyrinthine route. Postoperatively, 15 out of sixteen patients gained normal facial function while one had grade III facial weakness. Severe grade and sudden onset facial paralysis after temporal bone fracture should be surgically corrected as early as possible. The site of involvement of the facial canal and patient's hearing status should be considered in deciding the type of surgery to be applied.</td>\n",

The biomechanics of primary TBI involve a direct impact, practically extended to the base of the skull, and most of the skull base fractures (SBF) are identified in anterior and medial cranial fossa. Furthermore, those predicted in the medial area are related to fissures from temporal bones. \n",
            "Presentation of case: We report two cases of right facial nerve palsy initiated by SBF’s, which were diagnosed and treated  at  our  institution. The  3D CT evaluation  in  our  first  case  showed  a  longitudinal fracture  of the  right petrosal bone, which was longitudinal and transverse for the second case. Two cases of facial nerve palsy were \n",

            "Traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI)  is  an  important  contributor  to morbidity  and  mortality.  This  condition  has  recently  been  ascribed  as one of the most prominent medical problems in society [1,2]. Further -\n",
            "more, about 4% of all cases include skull base fractures (SBF) [3], which frequently  occurs  in  the  petrous  part  of  the  temporal  bone,  after high-energy  impact  trauma  [4].  However,  the  manifestation  at  the middle area of SBF’s (7–10%) is implicated in facial nerve damage, as \n",
            "these route through temporal bone [5,6]. The electrophysiologic testing and 3 D CT have been identified as valuable tools in the evaluation of anatomy,  pathomechanism,  prognosis  and  surgical  planning  [7]. Moreover, split hypoglossal facial anastomosis is a potent and depend -\n",

Subsequently, similar results were obtained after 6 months of rehabilitation, electrophysiological examination and clinical re-evaluation (HB scale). \n",
            "Therefore, we decided to perform the split hypoglossal facial anas- tomosis technique on both patients for the purpose of facial reanimation (Fig. 3A). The  surgical  microscopic  magnification shows  the  presenta - tion  of  hypoglossal  nerve,  characterized  by  longitudinal  dissected retrograde  (arrow,  blue),  spliced  to  connect  with  the  proximal  facial nerve (arrow, red), alongside several epineural sutures without tension and  indications  of thrombin  fibrine  glue  (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, anti - biotics  were  administered  post  operatively,  and  both  patients  were discharged in good recovery on the 10th day. \n",

            "any  fracture  involving  the  floor  of the  anterior,  middle  and  posterior cranial fossa, assumed to originate from either a direct local or remote force impact [8]. This has been implicated in approximately 4% of TBIs \n",
            "[3],  and  also  accounts  for  about  19%  of  all  skull  fractures  [11].  In addition,  blunt  trauma  is accountable for  over  90%  of all  SBF’s [12], with most injuries located in the anterior fossa (51%) [13]. Faried et al., reported  on  the  occurrence  of around  69.4%  of cases  in  the  anterior fossa, while 27.5% was in the middle cranial fossa [14]. Mokolane et al. described  the  center  area  as  the  most  common  target  point,  and  is assumed  as  the  weakest  area,  due  to  the  presence  of  neurovascular foramina  and  thin  bones  [13,15].  However,  the  most  frequently  frac- tured  spots,  as  observed  in  14–22%  of all  cases  were  in  the  temporal bone or laterobasal fractures, resulting from high energy blunt impact [16].  This  is congruent  with  other  studies,  where  30–47%  was  docu- mented [13]. \n",
            "The temporal bone is formed in five portions, including the squama \n",
            "\u000eas the lateral wall, alongside the mastoid, petrous, tympanic and styloid [4]. In addition, possible fractures are classified according to the rela- tionship  with  the  long  axis  of  the  petrous  pyramid,  comprising  the longitudinal, transverse and mixed. Approximately 80–90% of temporal bone fractures are longitudinal, with the crack line assumed to run along the roof of the external auditory canal, while 10–20% are transverse to the long axis of the petrous temporal bone [4,17]. Moreover, the facial nerve  maintains  a  potentially  precarious  route  through  the  temporal bone.  Hence,  there  is a high  liability  to  injury  after  the  experience  of skull  fracture  at  this  level  [18].  The  longitudinal  forms  have  been associated with facial nerve palsy, where 20–30% of cases result from lateral basal injury to nerves located within the facial canal, commonly in the geniculate ganglion region [17,19]. Conversely, transverse tem- poral  bone  fractures  are  much  rarer,  and  majorly  occur  after  severe trauma  to  the  occiput,  and  approximately  50%  of  patients  manifest immediate facial nerve paralysis [19]. \n",

            "The cases evaluated in this study showed longitudinal and transverse fractures of the petrosus after 3D CT examination. This assessment tool is useful in the detection of fractures as well as any facial deformity, and also assists in reconstruction surgical planning [7]. The classification of petrous bone fractures relies on clinical finding and confirmation by CT [17]. However, pathologic entities located in and around the skull base are  easily  overlooked  on  conventional  CT  images  obtained  at  the Emergency  Department [10].  The  3 D version  a gold  standard,  as the images  rendered  are  significantly  improved,  hence  the  application  is suitable in the radiological diagnosis of SBF’s [3,17,20]. \n",
            "Various scoring system have been devised for grading the severity of \n",
            "the facial  nerve impairment. The function was evaluated pre and post operatively,  using  the  grading  system  of  House  and  Brackman  (HB) scale. This is assumed to be the most universally accepted measure, due \n",
            "to the simplicity, reproducibility and low inter-observer variability [21]. The Facial Nerve Disorders Committee recommended the application of \n",
            "this  system  during  the  evaluation  and  report  of  all  recoveries  [22]. Furthermore, gross facial appearance was assessed at rest, with move- ment, during forehead gestures, and motion around the eyes and mouth. The results show a gradation of facial nerve function from HB I to VI on \n",
            "the scale [22–24]. \n",
            "Pre  operatively,  patient  no.1  (HB-III scale,  moderate  dysfunction) was better than no.2 (HB-IV scale, moderately severe dysfunction). This is possibly  explained  by  the  individuals’ state,  comprising  the  combi - nation longitudinal and transverse temporal bone fractures, indicating a high energy blunt impact. \n",
            "Also,  it  is  important  to  regularly  perform  clinical  assessment  and electrophysiological testing in the form of electroneurography (ENOG) \n",
            "and  electromyography (EMG), to  determine  the  timing  onset  of facial weakness and whether the injury is partial or complete [13]. However, surgery  is  usually  recommended  on  instances  where  no  regeneration potentials are noted with EMG, and after a prognosis of total paralysis with over 90% reduction in amplitude of motor response, as confirmed by  ENOG  [5,25].  Furthermore,  an  electrophysiological  examination conducted  on  the  2nd  week  showed  signs  of nerve  fiber  degeneration >95% by ENOG, while facial EMG provided information on the fibril- lation  potentials,  and  the  characteristic of denervated muscles.  Subse- quently,  similar  outcome  was  observed  after  exposure  to electrophysiological  testing  and  clinical  re-evaluation  after  6  months rehabilitation, using the HB III-IV scale. \n",
            "The hypoglossal facial nerve anastomosis remains the most popular        technique  applied  in  the  reanimation of paralyzed  faces  [26–28].  The main goal of this surgery is to restore facial symmetry, during rest, and \n",
            "also  while expressing  emotions,  demonstrating voluntary motions  and ensuring the preserved tongue function [22,26,29]. Moreover, the end \n",
            "to end method was first proposed by Korte ¨ and Bernhard in 1901, where \n",
            "a neural graft was used to suture the hypoglossal to the facial nerve. This procedure  was  widely  developed  in  the  works  of Balance  and  Duel  in 1932  [30],  and  has  been  associated  with  some  drawbacks,  including palsy  and  hypotrophy  of  the  ipsilateral  tongue,  leading  to  impaired swallowing and speech in 45% of patients [31]. However, Cusimano and Sekhar [27], and Arai et al. [23] developed a technique to prevent these functional  defects.  This  required  performing  anastomosis between  30 and  50%  of the  ipsilateral  hypoglossal  nerve,  to  finely  transect  a split longitudinal and connect the facial nerve, projecting to the tongue, in \n",
            "order to prevent musculature atrophy. \n",
