       "      <td>The hemitongue paralysis that occurs as a result of a classic hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover procedure can result in profound functional deficits in speech, mastication, and swallowing. The procedure is not an option in patients with bilateral facial paralysis or those at risk for combined cranial nerve deficits. To address some of the drawbacks and limitations of this classic procedure, we developed the hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional jump graft (12-7 jump graft) procedure. This procedure involves interposing a nerve graft between a partially severed but functionally intact twelfth cranial nerve and the degenerated seventh cranial nerve, and is often combined with other reanimation procedures. To date, we have performed 33 12-7 jump graft procedures in 30 patients (three were treated for bilateral facial paralysis); this report describes the procedure and its indications, and details the results of 23 procedures performed in 20 patients for whom 24-month follow-up data are available. Twelfth nerve deficits occurred in only three patients in this report. Recovery of facial function began between 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Facial tone and symmetry were achieved in every patient, no patient had significant mass movement, and 13 patients (two of whom were treated for bilateral facial paralysis) had excellent and three had superb restoration of facial movement. These results show the 12-7 jump graft to be a valuable adjunct for facial reanimation in selected patients.</td>\n",

A group of 37 patients who underwent five different combinations of reanimation was analyzed. The techniques were evaluated using a standard rating scheme for judging success of reanimation procedures. The combination of a masseter muscle transfer to the lower region of the face and a cable graft of the upper facial nerve division appeared to offer excellent results in terms of independent motion of the upper and lower regions of the face and good eye closure, while allowing spontaneous mimetic function in 50% of cases.

The majority of patients were treated in two stages with cross-facial nerve graft as the first stage and microvascular muscle transfer at the second stage. The gracilis muscle was used in 62 patients. A system of grading results has been utilized in the long-term evaluation. The overall final result was excellent or good in 51 percent of 47 patients who were available for follow-up. Although the results are not completely satisfactory, they justify the use of this approach to a difficult clinical problem. The results are improving as technical modifications to the procedure have evolved. The gracilis muscle is a reliable free transfer with internal anatomy conductive to use for reanimation of the paralyzed face. This type of transfer, in our experience, has proved superior to nonmicrosurgical methods for treatment of complete and severe incomplete facial palsy. The seventh cranial nerve is used in the innervation of the transferred muscle, the ipsilateral being preferable if available. The authors believe that use of the same cranial nerve is superior to methods that involve other cranial nerves, where spontaneity is often not achieved.</td>\n",

Advantages and disadvantages and indications and contraindications for its use in facial paralysis are presented in detail from an extensive clinical experience of almost 50 such microneurovascular transfers. Pitfalls that the reconstructive microsurgeon should beware and strengths in using this muscle for facial palsy are highlighted. The detailed operative approach is presented, with promise of undetectable scars and minimal functional loss. The strategies for how to inset this muscle unit in the new recipient site are given, along with the thought processes involved in selecting the actual sites of anchoring the muscle to reproduce a mirror image of the contralateral normal face. Finally, an exemplary clinical case demonstrating the use of the pectoralis minor muscle for both eye and lower face reanimation is presented in detail, demonstrating the dual nerve supply and the resulting independent eye and smile movements with total lack of mass action and/or synkinesis. Restorations of eye blink and of a symmetrical and coordinated smile are the frequent rewards of using this unique muscle for the correction of facial palsy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: Transferring the hypoglossal nerve to the facial nerve using an end-to-end method is very effective for improving facial motor function. However, this technique may result in hemitongue atrophy. The ansa cervicalis, which arises from the cervical plexus, is also used for facial reanimation. We retrospectively reviewed cases where facial reanimation was performed using the ansa cervicalis to overcome the shortcomings of existing techniques of hypoglossal nerve transfer. Methods: The records of 15 patients who underwent hypoglossal nerve transfer were retrospectively reviewed. Three methods were used: facial reanimation with hypoglossal nerve transfer (group 1), facial nerve reanimation using the ansa cervicalis (group 2), and sural nerve interposition grafting between the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerve (group 3). In group 1, the ansa cervicalis was coapted to neurotize the distal stump of the hypoglossal nerve in a subset of patients. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system and Emotrics software. Results: All patients in group 1 (n = 4) achieved H-B grade IV facial function and showed improvements in the oral commissure angle at rest (preoperative vs. postoperative difference, 6.48¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.77¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™) and while smiling (13.88¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 2.00¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™). In groups 2 and 3, the oral commissure angle slightly improved at rest (group 2: 0.95¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.53¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™, group 3: 1.35¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.02¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™) and while smiling (group 2: 2.06¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.67¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™, group 3: 1.23¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.56¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™). In group 1, reduced tongue morbidity was found in patients who underwent ansa cervicalis transfer. Conclusion: Facial reanimation with hypoglossal nerve transfer, in combination with hypoglossal nerve neurotization using the ansa cervicalis for complete facial palsy patients, might enable favorable facial reanimation outcomes and reduce tongue morbidity. Facial reanimation using the ansa cervicalis or sural nerve for incomplete facial palsy patients did not lead to remarkable improvements, but it warrants further investigation.</td>\n",

Various surgical facial reanimation techniques have been described to address this devastating condition. While traditional surgical approaches have proved successful in restoring either facial tone or facial movement, newer combination nerve transfer techniques are addressing the limitations of the traditional single nerve transfer approaches. Methods: This study aimed to describe a promising new surgical approach to facial reanimation utilizing a dual nerve transfer to maximize both resting and active symmetry while minimizing postoperative synkinesis. Here, we use the masseteric nerve to selectively innervate the miDFace in combination with a hypoglossal facial nerve graft to reanimate the remaining facial regions. Results: To date, we have performed this operation on four patients, all of whom tolerated the procedure well. Our patients are showing significant improvements in both resting facial tone and facial movement with no signs of synkinesis at 9 months postoperative. Conclusions: We believe this dual nerve transfer to be superior in restoring the combination of tone, symmetry, and movement to the paralyzed face when compared with traditional single nerve transfer approaches.</td>\n",

       "      <td>One-stage combined dynamic reanimation with static suspension has obvious advantages of improving facial symmetry. In clinical observation, patients with different levels of oral commissure drooping achieve different symmetry outcomes, despite undergoing the same surgical procedure. Patients with slight asymmetry obtain better outcomes than those with severe asymmetry. The mechanisms influencing postoperative outcomes have not been systematically explored. We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients performed with masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension. Patients were divided into two groups according to the level of oral commissure drooping: slight-asymmetry group (n = 24) and severe-asymmetry group (n = 20). Static and dynamic symmetry were assessed with FACE-gram software pre and postoperatively. The symmetry of the oral commissures at rest and during smiling significantly improved postoperatively in all patients. The differences of the bilateral oral commissure positions were significantly smaller in slight-asymmetry group than that in severe-asymmetry group (p&lt;0.001), indicating that slight-asymmetry group achieved better symmetry. Furthermore, these differences were caused by the oral commissures position on the unaffected side, both pre and postoperatively (p&lt;0.001), but not the paralyzed side's (p&gt;0.05). In conclusion, masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension achieved dynamic and static symmetry in patients with different levels of asymmetry. Patients with slight asymmetry obtained better postoperative symmetry than those with severe asymmetry. Postoperative facial asymmetry might be influenced by the hypertonicity of facial muscles on the unaffected side.</td>\n",

The masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer (MFNT) has many advantages in facial reanimation. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of our MFNT technique and define the potential factors predictive of outcome. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients who underwent MFNT using the temporofacial trunk of facial nerve. Videotapes and images were documented and evaluated according to Facial Nerve Grading Scale 2.0 (FNGS2.0) and Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (FGS). The quality-of-life was obtained using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale. Moreover, Facial Asymmetry Index (FAI), quantitative measurement of the width of palpebral fissure, deviation of the philtrum, and angles or excursions of the oral commissure were applied to explore the effect of the transfer metrically. Multivariable logistic regression models and Cox regression were prepared to predict the effect of MFNT by preoperative clinical features. The patients showed favorable outcomes graded by FNGS2.0, and experienced significantly improved scores in static and dynamic symmetry with slightly elevated scores in synkinesis evaluated by the Sunnybrook FGS. The score of FaCE Scale increased in all domains after reanimation. The quantitative indices indicated the symmetry restoration of the middle and lower face after MFNT. Regression analysis revealed that younger patients with severe facial paralysis are preferable to receive MFNT early for faster and better recovery, especially for traumatic causes. The findings demonstrate that MFNT is an effective technique for facial reanimation, and case screening based on clinical characteristics could be useful for surgical recommendation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: One approach to reanimating both upper and lower lips following facial palsy is through staged surgery: cross-face nerve grafting at stage I, free gracilis muscle transfer to levators at stage II and pedicled anterior belly of digastric muscle transfer (ABDMT) to depressors at stage III. The results of this approach were hitherto unquantified. Methods: This study retrospectively assessed peer-reviewed, patient-rated and objective outcomes following staged reanimation in adults between 2010 and 2020. Demographics, palsy characteristics and surgery details were recorded. Pre- and postoperative videos were rated by independent assessors using Terzis' aesthetic and symmetry scale. Photographs were analysed using Emotrics and patients completed the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) patient-rated outcome measure. Results: Ten patients [mean age = 34 (SD = 12.48)] were eligible. All regained lip elevation and depression. All markers of symmetry improved after gracilis transfer. All markers were also improved after ABDMT except for lower lip height when smiling with teeth showing (p &gt; 0.05). Five patients (50%) responded to the GBI (mean score = +39.44). No patients reported detriment from the reanimations. Mean Terzis' scores preoperatively and after stages II and III were 1.5, 2.26 and 2.39, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Nine patients underwent aesthetic refinements [lipofilling to lower lip notches (n = 5), debulking of gracilis bulk (n = 6), repositioning of muscle insertion (n = 5) and facelifts (n = 2)]. Conclusion: The outcomes were positive objectively and as judged by peers and patients themselves. Aesthetic refinements may also be required to enhance these results.</td>\n",
