0,1908974,Pub-med,Hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional-jump graft for facial reanimation without tongue atrophy,"The hemitongue paralysis that occurs as a result of a classic hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover procedure can result in profound functional deficits in speech, mastication, and swallowing. The procedure is not an option in patients with bilateral facial paralysis or those at risk for combined cranial nerve deficits. To address some of the drawbacks and limitations of this classic procedure, we developed the hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional jump graft (12-7 jump graft) procedure. This procedure involves interposing a nerve graft between a partially severed but functionally intact twelfth cranial nerve and the degenerated seventh cranial nerve, and is often combined with other reanimation procedures. To date, we have performed 33 12-7 jump graft procedures in 30 patients (three were treated for bilateral facial paralysis); this report describes the procedure and its indications, and details the results of 23 procedures performed in 20 patients for whom 24-month follow-up data are available. Twelfth nerve deficits occurred in only three patients in this report. Recovery of facial function began between 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Facial tone and symmetry were achieved in every patient, no patient had significant mass movement, and 13 patients (two of whom were treated for bilateral facial paralysis) had excellent and three had superb restoration of facial movement. These results show the 12-7 jump graft to be a valuable adjunct for facial reanimation in selected patients.",3,,0,2,2.0,0,2,1,0,10.1177/019459989110400609,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1991 Jun;104(6):818-25. doi: 10.1177/019459989110400609.,"May M, Sobol SM, Mester SJ.",1991,1908974,"Tools: Classification system (not specified) Outcomes:CN 12 deficits, tongue atrophy, difficulty swallowing, mastication, and speech",23.0,3.0,24.0,41.0,6.0,75.0,24.0,,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,

These techniques involve the use of nerve grafting or crossover procedures combined with a dynamic muscle transfer. A group of 37 patients who underwent five different combinations of reanimation was analyzed. The techniques were evaluated using a standard rating scheme for judging success of reanimation procedures. The combination of a masseter muscle transfer to the lower region of the face and a cable graft of the upper facial nerve division appeared to offer excellent results in terms of independent motion of the upper and lower regions of the face and good eye closure, while allowing spontaneous mimetic function in 50% of cases.

3,2359779,Pub-med,Results of management of facial palsy with microvascular free-muscle transfer,"This paper reports our experience in facial reanimation using free innervated muscle transfer in 69 patients with long-term facial palsy. The majority of patients were treated in two stages with cross-facial nerve graft as the first stage and microvascular muscle transfer at the second stage. The gracilis muscle was used in 62 patients. A system of grading results has been utilized in the long-term evaluation. The overall final result was excellent or good in 51 percent of 47 patients who were available for follow-up. Although the results are not completely satisfactory, they justify the use of this approach to a difficult clinical problem. The results are improving as technical modifications to the procedure have evolved. The gracilis muscle is a reliable free transfer with internal anatomy conductive to use for reanimation of the paralyzed face. This type of transfer, in our experience, has proved superior to nonmicrosurgical methods for treatment of complete and severe incomplete facial palsy. The seventh cranial nerve is used in the innervation of the transferred muscle, the ipsilateral being preferable if available.

5,3083357,Pub-med,Preliminary observations after facial rehabilitation with the ansa hypoglossi pedicle transfer,"Facial paralysis is a very disabling condition, both functionally and cosmetically. Despite the different methods of facial reanimation that have been described, there is no single method that will restore normal facial tone and motion. Of the methods available, primary neurorrhaphy is probably the most effective. The recovery period, however, is prolonged and, as a result, muscle tone and bulk may be lost. The hypoglossal-facial anastomosis is also a very reliable and effective technique but requires necessary interruption of both major cranial nerve trunks. Transfer of a neuromuscular pedicle (based on the ansa hypoglossi) has been offered as a method of facial reanimation that involves neither prolonged recovery nor interruption of the major cranial nerve functions. The application of this technique for reinnervation of a paralyzed larynx was first described by Tucker in 1970, and the technique was applied to facial muscle (in animal models) in 1977. The effectiveness of this technique--and its application in the management of facial paralysis in the human patient--remains controversial. We report our experience with a series of six patients who underwent neuromuscular pedicle transfer in conjunction with other more conventional methods of facial reanimation. The function of the pedicle and its contribution to the overall facial rehabilitation were assessed clinically and electromyographically. Factors influencing the success of the procedure and clinical and experimental evidence to support its application are discussed. While our experience with this technique is limited, it would appear that the neuromuscular pedicle transfer may play a useful adjunctive role in reanimation of the face in selective cases of facial paralysis.",3,,0,0,0.0,9,8,3,0,10.1177/019459988609400307,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1986 Mar;94(3):302-5. doi: 10.1177/019459988609400307.,"Anonsen CK, Duckert LG, Cummings CW.",1986,3083357,"Tools: EMG, clinical evaluation Outcomes: evidence of reinnervation, facial movements",6.0,5.15,,33.0,6.0,65.0,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,

7,7719600,Pub-med,Irreversible muscle contracture after functioning free muscle transplantation using the ipsilateral facial nerve for reinnervation,"Four patients who underwent functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) for facial reconstruction developed a progressive disfiguring muscle contracture. This complication has not been previously reported. Three of the patients had longstanding facial paralysis and were reanimated by FFMT. The fourth patient had left hemifacial atrophy but without facial paralysis. She also underwent FFMT for augmentation. All four FFMTs were innervated by the ipsilateral facial nerve. Initially, they all had a normal facial appearance at rest during the first few months after FFMT. However, they all developed a progressive severe muscle contracture from 6 to 12 months after FFMT. Continuous spontaneous electrical impulse activity, which stimulated the transferred muscle day and night, may be responsible for the progressive muscle contracture. From the patients' reported sensations and from clinical evaluation, which included a local xylocaine injection test, over-reinnervation with a synkinesis effect of the transferred muscle is hypothetically the main cause, not over-tension of the muscle itself. This complication may possibly be avoided by limiting or decreasing the number of fascicles from the ipsilateral facial nerve or better by using a cross-facial nerve graft instead of the ipsilateral facial nerve as the innervating motor nerve. The outcome with a cross-facial nerve is likely to be more predictable and reliable.",1,,0,0,1.0,7,4,1,0,10.1016/0007-1226(95)90021-7,Br J Plast Surg. 1995 Jan;48(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/0007-1226(95)90021-7.,"Chuang DC, Devaraj VS, Wei FC.",1995,7719600,,4.0,5.25,8.0,20.25,15.0,26.0,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,

Using this technique, the mastoid process is partially resected to open the stylomastoid foramen and the descending portion of the facial nerve in the mastoid cavity is exposed by drilling to the level of the external genu and then sectioning its most proximal portion. The hypoglossal nerve beneath the internal jugular vein is exposed at the level of the axis and dissected as proximally as possible. One-half of the hypoglossal nerve is transected: use of less than one-half of the hypoglossal nerve is adequate for approximation to the distal stump of the atrophic facial nerve. The nerve endings, the proximally cut end of the hypoglossal nerve, and the distal stump of the facial nerve are approximated and anastomosed without tension. This technique was used in four patients with long-standing facial paralysis (greater than 24 months), and it provided satisfactory facial reanimation, with no evidence of hemitongue atrophy or dysfunction. Because it completely preserves glossal function, the hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis described here constitutes a successful approach in patients with long-standing facial paralysis who do not wish to have tongue function compromised.",3,,0,0,0.0,7,4,1,0,10.3171/jns.1997.86.2.0203,J Neurosurg. 1997 Feb;86(2):203-6. doi: 10.3171/jns.1997.86.2.0203.,"Sawamura Y, Abe H.",1997,9010420,May's grading system,4.0,8.0,12.0,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,anastomosis",,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
12,9495461,Pub-med,The gracilis free flap revisited: a review of 25 cases of transfer to traumatic extremity wounds,"Trauma to the extremities often results in a complex bony and soft-tissue injury requiring free flap reconstruction. Muscles from various body sites have been used in extremity reconstruction since the early 1970s. The gracilis muscle is usually not considered the first choice for free flap reconstruction of these defects. It is usually relegated to small defects or used to reanimate the face. Our purpose is to present our experience with the gracilis muscle as a first-choice flap in reconstruction of traumatic extremity defects. A retrospective review of all gracilis muscle free flap transfers for traumatic extremity wounds between 1988 and 1995 at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth was performed. Twenty-five patients age 20 to 71 years (mean, 29.7 years) underwent 26 free flaps to the lower leg, ankle, foot, or forearm to cover traumatic wounds. Defects ranged in size from 3 x 3 cm (9 cm2) to 13 x 18 cm (234 cm2), with a mean of 75.5 cm2. There were no flap losses and all wounds healed. Nine patients experienced 11 complications, which consisted of minor wound separation (16%), wound infection (12%), partial or complete loss of split-thickness skin graft (8%), thrombosis of graft with successful revascularization (4%), and nonunion of an underlying fracture (4%). Our overall success rate for gracilis free flap reconstruction of traumatic wounds is 100%. The gracilis free muscle flap has become our first option for tissue coverage in traumatized extremities. It leaves minimal functional defect limited to the side of the primary injury and provides a good cosmetic result. It can cover large defects when the epimysium is cut, and allows an epidural block to be performed for sympathectomy effect and pain control in the affected extremity during the immediate postoperative period.",0,,1,2,0.0,0,0,0,0,10.1097/00000637-199802000-00006,Ann Plast Surg. 1998 Feb;40(2):141-4. doi: 10.1097/00000637-199802000-00006.,"Zukowski M, Lord J, Ash K, Shouse B, Getz S, Robb G.",1998,9495461,"gracilis flap to extremities, no info on face",25.0,,,33.0,9.0,63.0,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

Although the results are promising, the two operations, about 1 year apart, exert an economic burden on the patients and require a lengthy period before obtaining results. Sequelae such as hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and conspicuous scar on the donor leg for harvesting a sural nerve graft also cannot be disregarded. To overcome such drawbacks of the two-stage method, we report a refined technique utilizing one-stage microvascular free transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle. Its thoracodorsal nerve is crossed through the upper lip and sutured to the contralateral intact facial nerve branches. Reinnervation of the transferred muscle is established at a mean of 7 months postoperatively, which is faster than that of the two-stage method.

The principle of this method is that the sling around the muscle pulls the oral commissure laterally and backward by the restoring force of the muscle from its relaxed position to its contracted position. The surgical procedure is simple. The sling is passed around the anterior half of the muscle so that the muscle can be bowed anteriorly at its center by the sling. One end of the sling is sutured to the center of the orbicularis oris and the dermis in front of the nasolabial fold, and the other end is sutured to the lower lip and oral commissure. This method was applied to 3 patients with facial palsy and to 1 patient with oral cancer. The restored motion of the oral commissure ranged from 5 to 8 mm when clenching the jaws. The concept of this method differs from those of other muscle transposition methods for facial reanimation in that the force acts at a right angle to the muscle contraction. The advantage of this method is that it is less invasive to the muscle and is a simpler procedure than other conventional muscle transposition methods.",0,,0,3,3.0,3,4,1,0,10.1097/00000637-199910000-00002,Ann Plast Surg. 1999 Oct;43(4):354-8. doi: 10.1097/00000637-199910000-00002.,"Maegawa J, Saijo M, Murasawa S.",1999,10517460,,3.0,,36.0,,,,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
16,10884169,Embase,Facial reanimation with jump interpositional graft hypoglossal facial anastomosis and hypoglossal facial anastomosis: Evolution in management of facial paralysis,"When viable proximal facial nerve is inaccessible, facial nerve paralysis has been classically managed with the hypoglossal facial anastomosis (HFA) for at least the past 70 years. While this procedure has proven its reliability, its problems with hemilingual atrophy (speech deglutition, drooling, mastication), hypertonia, synkinesis, and mimetic deficits indicate the need for a more perfect solution for facial paralysis. The jump interpositional graft hypoglossal facial anastomosis (JIGHFA) along with gold weight lid implantation and electromyographic (EMG) rehabilitation achieves substantial facial reanimation without hemilingual deficits. We present our results in 18 patients who underwent JIGHFA along with gold weight lid implantation and EMG rehabilitation for facial paralysis. These results were compared with those from published series of 30 patients treated with HFA with EMG rehabilitation evaluated with objective (House-Brackmann) criteria. Anonymous retrospective information from questionnaires from 22 of 48 patients who were treated with the classic HFA was also presented. In properly selected patients, the JIGHFA technique is capable of achieving substantial facial reinnervation (House-Brackmann grade III or better) in 83.3% of the patients without hemilingual sequelae which was seen in 45% of the HFA patients. In contrast to the HFA, this procedure can be used by patients with concomitant lower cranial nerve paralysis (except hypoglossal), and bilateral facial paralysis.

Of the 20 patients who completed the questionnaire, 18 showed a positive benefit (median score 59.5, range 40-77). There was a significant correlation (P < 0.045) between the Glasgow benefit inventory score and House Brackmann grade. Outcome was not affected by the time interval between the acoustic neuroma surgery and performing the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, sex or length of follow-up. However the Glasgow benefit score was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.023) with younger patients showing more benefit independent of improvement in facial nerve function.",3,,0,0,9.0,9,2,1,0,10.1046/j.1365-2273.2000.00348.x,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci. 2000 Jun;25(3):219-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2273.2000.00348.x.,"Sood S, Anthony R, Homer JJ, Van Hille P, Fenwick JD.",2000,10944053,"neg: food spillage, speech worsened, embarrassed to eat in public, trouble clearing buccal debris",29.0,6.0,12.0,,,,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,

In 15 patients, neurovascular transfer of 16 segments of the gracilis muscle to the cheek was performed for reanimation of oral commissure movement. Voluntary muscle activation was evaluated by electromyography (EMG) and clinical function was assessed both metrically from frontal photographs and by a rating system with 6 categories. Patient satisfaction was explored through a self-administered questionnaire of general health (SF-36 health survey). The average follow-up period was 49.3 months. All patients showed voluntary activation of the grafted muscles in the EMG. Symmetry of the static and dynamic position of the oral commissure at rest and under function was considerably improved. In general, however, there was a tendency for undercorrection particularly in a vertical direction. Under function, the excursion of the oral commissure on the grafted side reached 63.7% and 65.5% of the nonparetic side in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. Subjective rating of patient well-being showed that the scores were higher than or comparable to those of healthy adults in six of eight areas of evaluation.",0,,1,1,0.0,9,8,3,0,,Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2000 Aug;29(4):243-9.,"Schliephake H, Schmelzeisen R, Tr‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°ger M.",2000,11030393,"Tools:EMG, clinical evaluation, Self administered questionnaire for general health (DF-36)Outcomes:patient satisfaction, excursion of the oral commissure,",15.0,0.75,1.0,31.2,6.0,59.0,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

A retrospective study was performed on 23 patients treated between 1988 and 1997 at the 2nd and 4th ENT chairs of University ""La Sapienza"" of Rome for facial palsy following cerebellopontine angle surgery. Tumors included acoustic neuromas (n = 3). Seventeen patients underwent hypoglossal-facial anastomoses [10 with end-to-end anastomoses, 4 with May's interposition ""jump-nerve"" grafts and 3 with partial (30%) use of the hypoglossal nerve plus a facial cross-over]. The remaining patients were operated on using a cable graft with the sural nerve (n = 2) and the great auricular nerve (n = 4). Postoperative facial function was determined by the House-Brackmann 6-scale classification. The hypoglossal-facial anastomoses resulted in long-term grade III or IV findings. Cable grafts improved facial function from grade VI to grade III. None of the patients operated on with the modfied VII-XII anastomosis developed swallowing disturbances. The ten patients having traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomoses showed different degrees of tongue disability and retention of residue in the oral cavity. Surgical recovery of postoperative facial palsy can be obtained with various techniques according to the availability of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem. Since a traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomosis procedure can be a source of a separate disability for the patient, techniques are preferred that leave the hypoglossal nerve mostly intact and uncompromised.",3,,0,2,9.0,9,2,1,0,10.1007/s004059900211,European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (2001) 258:1 (45-48).

Study design: A retrospective review of patients undergoing facial nerve repair from 1963-1997. Methods: One hundred and three patients underwent surgical intervention designed to repair a disrupted facial nerve. All procedures were performed by one of the senior surgeons (M.M.) Seventy-two patients had a complete data set and at least one year of follow-up. Results: Eighty percent of patients attained an outcome considered superb to fair. Twenty percent of patients had a poor outcome. There was a slight worsening of outcome with increased time to repair. Patients with a neoplastic etiology of nerve paralysis tended to have a worse outcome. Conclusions: Facial nerve grafting is most successful if intervention is undertaken at or near the time of initial injury. However, prolonged time (up to two years) to repair does not preclude the potential for some recovery. The limitations of the current systems for grading facial recovery after nerve repair are well known, and the adoption of a new grading scale for assessing recovery after reanimation procedure is recommended.",0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,10.1055/s-2000-15545,Facial Plast Surg. 2000;16(4):309-13. doi: 10.1055/s-2000-15545.,"Bascom DA, Schaitkin BM, May M, Klein S.",2000,11460296,"Tools: HB score Outcomes: facial movement,",72.0,8.7,4.0,37.3,6.0,80.0,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:nerve graft,nerve grafting",,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

This technique is supposed to overcome loss of hypoglossal function. Methods: Tongue function in 39 consecutive patients and facial reanimation in 29 patients who completed 24 months follow-up were assessed. Facial nerve function was judged using the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. Results: Tongue movements were normal in all operated on patients. Initial facial movements occurred on average 7.5 months postoperatively. The results were graded HB II in 6 (20.9%), HB III in 13 (44.6%), HB IV in 7 (24.1%), HB V in 2 (6.8%) patients, and HB VI in 1 (3.4%) patient. The results were significantly better in young patients and when a short time interval between paralysis and surgery existed.

22,11783965,Embase,Hypoglossal-facial crossover in facial-nerve palsy: Pure end-to-side anastomosis technique,"Hypoglossal-facial crossover is the most popular method of reconstructing the facial nerve in facial palsy resulting from proximal facial-nerve injury near the brainstem. Conventional hypoglossal-facial crossover involves performing a partial hypoglossal-nerve section or incision and an interpositional nerve graft to bridge the gap between the two nerves, which sometimes results in hemiglossal atrophy and its sequelae. Furthermore, the nerve graft may delay recovery and make facial reanimation weak. To solve these problems, we attempted to perform 'pure end-to-side anastomosis' (without section of the hypoglossal nerve) between the hypoglossal and facial nerves in four patients with facial palsy. In two patients (group I) a sural-nerve graft was used to bridge the gap between the two nerves. In the other two patients (group II) the intratemporal facial nerve was mobilised to the neck and one tension-free end-to-side anastomosis was performed. Facial symmetry and tone at rest were restored in all cases. Facial reanimation was achieved in group II after 8 months. Despite the small number of cases, we believe that the technique of hypoglossal-facial crossover with 'pure end-to-side anastomosis' and mobilisation of the intratemporal facial nerve can decrease donor-nerve morbidity in facial-nerve rehabilitation. ¬¨¬© 2002 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.",3,,0,0,0.0,9,4,1,0,10.1054/bjps.2001.3727,British Journal of Plastic Surgery (2002) 55:1 (25-31).

23,11818819,Pub-med,Cross-face nerve graft with free-muscle transfer for reanimation of the paralyzed face: a comparative study of the single-stage and two-stage procedures,"The most accepted method for reanimation of the paralyzed face is the two-stage method that combines cross-face nerve graft with free-muscle transfer. Although the results of reconstruction with this method are satisfactory, there is an excessive delay between stages, which prolongs the period of rehabilitation. In 1995, Kumar overcame this and presented his preliminary results from a single-stage transfer of the gracilis. We compared the long-term results of the single-stage with the two-stage method of reconstruction. Patients selected the method of reconstruction on the basis of the information, photographs of scars, and video recording of results given to them at a special facial palsy clinic. Ten patients selected the single-stage reconstruction and 15 selected the two-stage reconstruction. The mean follow-up period was 3 years. The results of the two methods are comparable, with 90 percent of the patients who underwent the single-stage and 93 percent of those who underwent the two-stage procedures having good and fair results. However, the two-stage method scored good symmetry at rest in 67 percent, compared with 20 percent for the single-stage method. There were fewer complications with the single-stage method, and none of the patients had any problems relating to the donor site.

24,14663218,Pub-med,Upper labial deficiency in Mobius syndrome: a previously unreported feature and its correction,"Bilateral facial palsy in M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome remains one of the greatest challenges in reconstructive plastic surgery. Facial reanimation is an invaluable aid to such patients because it allows for greater social interaction by means of the ability to smile. In performing facial reanimation surgery on patients with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome, it is the observation of the senior author (Harrison) that upper labial deficiency is a consistent and previously unreported feature of the syndrome. It has been the practice of the senior author to perform upper labial augmentation on M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome patients by insertion of a lipodermal autograft, in addition to facial reanimation.

All nine possessed bilateral facial palsy and upper labial deficiency in addition to other abnormalities consistent with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome. Six patients underwent bilateral facial reanimation and upper labial augmentation alone. One patient refused facial reanimation surgery but consented to upper labial augmentation. One patient, with concomitant micrognathia, underwent bilateral facial reanimation, upper labial augmentation, and insertion of a Silastic chin implant. In one patient, a child who also exhibited micrognathia, bilateral facial reanimation alone was carried out, with further procedures for upper labial and chin cosmesis being postponed until adulthood. The indication for performing upper labial augmentation was cosmetic. The procedure improved upper labial appearance and restored balance to the mouth. Patients also expressed higher satisfaction with eating and drinking, which they related to the improved fullness of the upper lip. This was before the facial reanimation had become functional.

25,14707630,Pub-med,Free proximal gracilis muscle and its skin paddle compound flap transplantation for complex facial paralysis,"Gracilis functioning free-muscle transplantation for the correction of pure facial paralysis has been a preferred method used by many reconstructive microsurgeons. However, for complex facial paralysis, the deficits include facial paralysis along with soft-tissue, mucosa, and/or skin defects. No adequate solution has been proposed. Treatment requests in those patients are not only for facial reanimation but also for correction of the defects. Of 161 patients with facial paralysis treated with gracilis functioning free-muscle transplantation from 1986 to 2002, eight patients (5 percent) presented with complex deficits requiring not only facial reanimation but also aesthetic correction of tissue defects. The tissue defects included an intraoral defect created following contracture release (one patient), infra-auricular radiation dermatitis with contour depression (one patient), temporal depression following a temporalis muscle-fascia transfer (one patient), ear deformity (two patients), and infra-auricular atrophic tissue with contour depression (three patients). A compound flap, consisting of a gracilis muscle with its overlying skin paddle separated into two components, was transferred for simultaneous correction of both problems. The blood supply to the gracilis and to the skin paddle originated from the same source vessel and therefore required the anastomosis of only one set of vessels. The versatility of this compound flap allows for a wide arc of rotation of the skin paddle around the muscle. All flaps were transferred successfully without complications. Satisfactory results of facial reanimation were recorded in five patients after all stages were completed. The remaining three patients are undergoing physical therapy and waiting for revision of the skin paddle.",0,,1,1,2.0,2,4,2,0,10.1097/01.PRS.0000096092.09655.63,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2004 Jan;113(1):126-32; discussion 133-5. doi: 10.1097/01.PRS.0000096092.09655.63.,"Chuang DC, Mardini S, Lin SH, Chen HC.",2004,14707630,,8.0,,,,,,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
26,15114115,Pub-med,Neurovascular free-muscle transfer for the treatment of established facial paralysis following ablative surgery in the parotid region,"Neurovascular free-muscle transfer for facial reanimation was performed as a secondary reconstructive procedure for 45 patients with facial paralysis resulting from ablative surgery in the parotid region. This intervention differs from neurovascular free-muscle transfer for treatment of established facial paralysis resulting from conditions such as congenital dysfunction, unresolved Bell palsy, Hunt syndrome, or intracranial morbidity, with difficulties including selection of recipient vessels and nerves, and requirements for soft-tissue augmentation. This article describes the authors' operative procedure for neurovascular free-muscle transfer after ablative surgery in the parotid region. Gracilis muscle (n = 24) or latissimus dorsi muscle (n = 21) was used for transfer. With gracilis transfer, recipient vessels comprised the superficial temporal vessels in 12 patients and the facial vessels in 12. For latissimus dorsi transfer, recipient vessels comprised the facial vessels in 16 patients and the superior thyroid artery and superior thyroid or internal jugular vein in four. Facial vessels on the contralateral side were used with interpositional graft of radial vessels in the remaining patient with latissimus dorsi transfer. Cross-face nerve grafting was performed before muscle transfer in 22 patients undergoing gracilis transfer. In the remaining two gracilis patients, the ipsilateral facial nerve stump was used as the primary recipient nerve. Dermal fat flap overlying the gracilis muscle was used for cheek augmentation in one patient. In the other 23 patients, only the gracilis muscle was used. With latissimus dorsi transfer, the ipsilateral facial nerve stump was used as the recipient nerve in three patients, and a cross-face nerve graft was selected as the recipient nerve in six. The contralateral facial nerve was selected as the recipient nerve in 12 patients, and a thoracodorsal nerve from the latissimus dorsi muscle segment was crossed through the upper lip to the primary recipient branches. A soft-tissue flap was transferred simultaneously with the latissimus muscle segment in three patients. Contraction of grafted muscle was not observed in two patients with gracilis transfer and in three patients with latissimus dorsi transfer. In one patient with gracilis transfer and one patient with latissimus dorsi transfer, acquired muscle contraction was excessive, resulting in unnatural smile animation. The recipient nerves for both of these patients were the ipsilateral facial nerve stumps, which were dissected by opening the facial nerve canal in the mastoid process. From the standpoint of operative technique, the one-stage transfer for latissimus dorsi muscle appears superior. Namely, a combined soft-tissue flap can provide sufficient augmentation for depression of the parotid region following wide resection. A long vascular stalk of thoracodorsal vessels is also useful for anastomosis, with recipient vessels available after extensive ablation and neck dissection.",1,,1,3,0.0,9,2,1,0,10.1097/01.prs.0000117186.10112.87,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2004 May;113(6):1563-72. doi: 10.1097/01.prs.0000117186.10112.87.,"Takushima A, Harii K, Asato H, Ueda K, Yamada A.",2004,15114115,"Tools: Grading scale Outcomes: voluntary contraction, smile gracilis and LD",45.0,,,34.2,5.0,65.0,,,Multiple nerve grafts:cross-face,gracilis and LD,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,
27,15148131,Pub-med,Multivectored suture suspension: a minimally invasive technique for reanimation of the paralyzed face,"Background: Despite advanced techniques for reanimation of the lower face, many patients opt for static suspension procedures, which are less invasive and have a relatively short recovery period. However, even static suspension procedures require general anesthesia, overnight hospital stay, and significant soft tissue manipulation. We present a minimally invasive technique, the multivectored suture suspension, which addresses these drawbacks. Objectives: To study the technical feasibility and efficacy of the multivectored suture suspension technique in the paralyzed face. Design: The study was carried out prospectively in 12 patients with House-Brackmann grade 6 facial paralysis. Nine patients presented within 6 months of tumor resection and 3 patients presented more than 1 year after surgery. Main outcome measures: The parameters evaluated were (1). restoration of nasal breathing; (2). improvement of drooling; (3). restoration of normal speech; (4). cosmetic results; and (5). total surgical time. Results: With an average follow-up of 14 months, patient evaluation of the outcome parameters was as follows: (1). 10 patients (83%) reported significant and 2 (17%) reported moderate restoration of nasal breathing; (2). 10 patients (83%) reported significant improvement and 2 (17%) reported modest drooling improvement; (3). 8 patients (66%) reported significant improvement and 4 (34%) reported modest improvement of speech; (4). 9 patients (75%) reported complete satisfaction and 3 (25%) reported moderate satisfaction with cosmesis. The average surgical time was 46 minutes. Three revisions were required for suture failure. Conclusions: The multivectored suture suspension technique is a minimally invasive, reversible method of lower facial reanimation that provides improved cosmesis with restoration of nasal breathing.

However, the functional outcome may be unpredictable. We therefore need to know more about the factors that influence the final result. We have recorded the long-term results of microneurovascular surgery in facial paralysis, and evaluated which factors influenced the functional outcome. Twenty-seven of 40 patients aged 7 to 65 years (mean 40) operated on at Helsinki University Hospital between 1986 and 2000 were available for interview and video recording. The gracilis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior muscles were used for microneurovascular transfer in 11, 10, and 6 cases, respectively. The outcome of microneurovascular muscle transfer was graded on House's scale 1 to 6. The mean follow-up period was 8.5 years (range 2 to 15). Sixteen patients (59%) displayed only mild or moderate dysfunction (grades 2 to 3) after reconstruction. In 8 patients (30%) dysfunction was graded as moderately severe, and in 3 (11%) as severe. There was a correlation between final functional outcome and the follow-up time after microneurovascular facial reanimation. The longer the follow-up time after muscle transplantation the poorer the functional result (p = 0.003).

29,15731666,Embase,Evaluation of a new measurement tool for facial paralysis reconstruction,"Evaluation of facial movement, including distance and direction, is essential for anyone interested in facial paralysis reconstruction. The authors' goal was to develop a measurement system that is simple, uses commercially available equipment, takes little time, and provides meaningful and accurate measurements. This technique is called the facial reanimation measurement system. It involves placing dots around the patient's mouth and video recording the patient performing maximal effort smiles. Using a video editing program, one frame showing the patient at rest is overlaid with a second frame showing the patient's smile. This overlaid image is imported into Adobe PhotoShop, where measurements are obtained using tools available in the program. Twenty patients were used to test interrater and intrarater reliability of the facial reanimation measurement system. The accuracy of the measurement process was tested by comparing 10 known distances and angles with those obtained using the facial reanimation measurement system. Both intrarater and interrater reliability of the distance and angle measurements are highly accurate, with intraclass correlations greater than 0.9. The facial reanimation measurement system is accurate to within 0.6 mm and 2.0 degrees when compared with a ""known"" distance and angle. The facial reanimation measurement system has been used to measure smile movements of more than 200 patients and has been demonstrated to be valuable for detecting changes of facial movements over time. This system is simple and economical and only requires 20 minutes to perform.

30,16217461,Embase,Selective marginal mandibular neurectomy for treatment of the marginal mandibular lip deformity in patients with chronic unilateral facial palsies,"Background: For unilateral facial palsies, reanimation techniques such as cross-facial nerve grafting with free muscle transfer have been very successful at improving symmetrical lip elevation when smiling. However, these procedures do not address the residual asymmetry with respect to lip depression resulting from an uncorrected marginal mandibular nerve palsy. Techniques that do address this residual lip asymmetry have had variable results. Selective neurectomy of the unaffected marginal mandibular nerve has largely been abandoned as a treatment since it has been reported to result in severe oral functional and cosmetic deficiencies. The authors argue that selective marginal mandibular neurectomy is a reliable technique for treatment of the marginal mandibular lip deformity that does not compromise oral functionality. Methods: Thirteen patients with unilateral facial palsies underwent selective marginal mandibular neurectomy of the unaffected side; the procedure was performed by the principal investigator. These patients were then evaluated on the basis of symmetry with smiling and oral functionality. Twelve of the patients were contacted and questioned with a standardized questionnaire. Twelve of the patients were evaluated independently for symmetry with smiling using randomized preoperative and postoperative photographs. Results: Eleven of the 12 patients reported either improvement or no change in oral competence. Ten of the 12 patients reported either improvement or great improvement in symmetry with smiling. Improvement in symmetry with smiling was independently observed 77.2 percent of the time.

31,16641724,Embase,One-stage reanimation of the paralyzed face using the rectus abdominis neurovascular free flap,"BACKGROUND: Functional free muscle transfer for the surgical correction of long-standing facial paralysis has gained validity over the past three decades. These traditionally multistep reconstructions often achieve clinical success, but at the cost of significant morbidity and lengthy recovery periods. To address this dilemma, the authors propose reconstruction using the rectus abdominis and accompanying intercostal nerve in a one-stage neurovascular free flap reanimation procedure. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, five patients with long-standing unilateral facial paralysis at the University of Pittsburgh Facial Nerve Center underwent reanimation using the authors' protocol. Preoperative and postoperative assessments included clinical evaluation using the Facial Grading System and electromyography. The patients were followed for a mean of 16 months. RESULTS: At the final postoperative visit, all five patients demonstrated improved levator electromyographic potential, with a median 67 percent improvement. All five patients further demonstrated an increase in zygomaticus electromyographic potential, with a median 225 percent improvement. All five patients demonstrated increased Facial Grading System score at most recent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The one-step reanimation using free rectus abdominis neurovascular free flap demonstrated a consistent positive outcome in electromyographic and clinical assessments. The additional benefits of reduced recovery time and anatomical reliability of the flap render the authors' method preferable to other traditional methods of surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face.

Since facial paralysis due to ablative surgery or some specific disease sometimes accompanies defects of the facial skin and soft tissue, simultaneous reconstruction of defective tissues with facial reanimation is required. The present paper reports results for 16 patients who underwent reconstruction by simultaneous soft tissue flap transfer with latissimus dorsi muscle for smile reconstruction of the paralysed face. Soft tissue flaps comprised skin paddle overlying the latissimus dorsi muscle (n=6), serratus anterior musculocutaneous flap (n=5), serratus anterior muscle flap (n=2), and latissimus dorsi perforator-based flap with a small muscle cuff (n=3). The latissimus dorsi muscle can be elevated as a compound flap of various types, and thus offers the best option as a donor muscle for facial reanimation when soft tissue defects require simultaneous reconstruction. ¬¨¬© 2005 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,1,0.0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2005.10.011,"Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (2006) 59:5 (465-473).

When the facial nerve is transected or severely compromised and primary end-to-end repair is not possible, hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis remains the most popular method for accomplishing three main goals: restoring facial tone, restoring facial symmetry, and facilitating return of voluntary facial movement. Our objectives are to evaluate the surgical feasibility and long-term outcomes of our technique of direct facial-to-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with a parotid-release maneuver. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Academic tertiary care referral center. Patients: Ten patients with facial paralysis from proximal nerve injury underwent the facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with a parotid-release maneuver. Main outcome measures: The Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and photographs. Results: Facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with parotid release was technically feasible in all cases, and anastomosis was performed distal to the origin of the ansa hypoglossi. All patients had good return of facial nerve function. Nine patients had scores of C or better, indicating strong eyelid and oral sphincter closure and mass motion. There was no hemilingual atrophy and no subjective tongue dysfunction. Conclusions: The parotid-release maneuver mobilizes additional length to the facial nerve, facilitating a tensionless communication distal to the ansa hypoglossi.

Methods: Retrospective review of 7 consecutive patients who underwent orthodromic transfer of the temporalis muscle insertion for the treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. Patients underwent facial-retraining physical therapy before and shortly after the procedure. Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, objective measurements of oral commissure elevation with smiling, and physician grading of preoperative and postoperative patient photographs. Medical records were reviewed for complications. Results: Patient satisfaction was high, with a mean score of 8.5 (possible score of 10). Four patients were physician graded as excellent to superb. The other 3 patients were rated as having good postoperative results. Movement was identified in every patient and ranged from 1.6 to 8.5 mm, with mean movement of the oral commissure of 4.2 mm. One patient developed postoperative salivary fluid collection that required drainage. Conclusions: Temporalis tendon transfer is a relatively easy procedure to perform that has distinct advantages compared with other forms of facial reanimation and provides very good results.

We used it on five patients who had facial palsy after excision of malignant parotid tumours. The wide skin defect that exposed the masseter muscle after total parotidectomy was reconstructed with a free flap. This method differs from those of other methods of transposing the masseter muscle in that force is applied at an upper lateral angle.

36,18470830,Pub-med,Free tissue transfer for the treatment of facial paralysis,"Long-standing facial paralysis requires the introduction of viable, innervated dynamic muscle to restore facial movement. The options include regional muscle transfer and microvascular free tissue transfer. There are advantages and disadvantages of each. Briefly, the regional muscle transfer procedures are reliable and provide immediate return of movement. However, the movement is not of a spontaneous mimetic nature. Free tissue transfer, in contrast, offers the possibility of synchronous, mimetic movement. It does, however, require a prolonged healing time in comparison with that of regional muscle transfer. The choice is made by physician and patient together, taking into account their preferences and biases. Muscle-alone free tissue transfer is our preferred option for reanimation of uncomplicated facial paralysis without skin or soft tissue deficits. Combined muscle and other tissue (most are skin flap) is another preferred option for more challenging complex facial paralysis with skin or soft tissue deficits after tumor excision. Gracilis flap is the author's first choice of muscle transplantation for both reconstructions. From 1986 to 2006, gracilis functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) was performed at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital for facial reanimation in 249 cases of facial paralysis. The main etiology is postoperative complication and Bell's palsy. The innervating nerve comes mostly from contralateral facial nerve branches, few from ipsilateral facial nerve due to tumor ablation, and from ipsilateral motor branch to masseter or spinal accessory nerve due to M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome.

37,18797361,Pub-med,Hemihypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy after mastoid dissection of the facial nerve: results in 24 patients and comparison with the classic technique,"Objective: Hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy has been widely used for reanimation of paralyzed facial muscles after irreversible proximal injury of the facial nerve. However, complete section of the hypoglossal nerve occasionally results in hemiglossal dysfunction and interferes with swallowing and speech. To reduce this morbidity, a modified technique with partial section of the hypoglossal nerve after mastoid dissection of the facial nerve (HFM) has been used. We report our experience with the HFM technique, retrospectively comparing the outcome with results of the classic hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy. Methods: A retrospective review was performed in 36 patients who underwent hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with the classic (n = 12) or variant technique (n = 24) between 2000 and 2006. Facial outcome was evaluated with the House-Brackmann grading system, and tongue function was evaluated with a new scale proposed to quantify postoperative tongue alteration. The results were compared, and age and time between nerve injury and surgery were correlated with the outcome. Results: There was no significant difference between the two techniques concerning facial reanimation. A worse outcome of tongue function, however, was associated with the classic technique (Mann-Whitney U test; P < 0.05). When HFM was used, significant correlations defined by the Spearman test were identified between preoperative delay (rho = 0.59; P = 0.002) or age (rho = 0.42; P = 0.031) and results of facial reanimation evaluated with the House-Brackmann grading system. Conclusion: HFM is as effective as classic hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy for facial reanimation, and it has a much lower morbidity related to tongue function.

38,18842469,Embase,Masseteric-facial nerve coaptation - an alternative technique for facial nerve reinnervation,"Background: Reinnervation of the facial musculature when there is loss of the proximal facial nerve poses a difficult clinical problem. Restoration of spontaneous mimetic motion is the aim and, to this end, the use of cross-facial nerve grafts has long been considered the reconstruction of choice. The nerve to masseter has been used very successfully for reinnervation of microvascular functioning muscle transfers for facial reanimation in established facial palsy but its use as a direct nerve transfer to the facial nerve to reinnervate 'viable' facial musculature has been scarce. Methods: Electron micrographic studies of axonal counts in the nerve to masseter and nerve to gracilis in a clinical series of seven patients undergoing surgery for facial nerve palsy were made. Based on these results, and previous success with the use of the nerve to masseter for reinnervation of free gracilis transfers, we report our experience with the transfer of the nerve to masseter for direct coaptation with the ipsilateral facial nerve to restore facial motion. Results: Our axonal counts of the nerve to masseter have, on average, 1542 ¬¨¬± 291.70 (SD) axons. Historical data have shown that the buccal branch of the facial nerve has 834 ¬¨¬± 285 (SD) where the distal end of a cross-facial nerve graft has 100 to 200 axons. Our clinical use of the nerve to masseter as a direct nerve transfer in three patients based on these data has resulted in significant improvement in facial symmetry in repose (at a minimum of 1 year follow up), restoration of facial motion with occasional spontaneous activity and minimal synkinesis without any donor morbidity. Conclusions: The advantages of this technique include the ease of dissection, constant and reliable anatomy, powerful reinnervation of the facial muscles without donor site morbidity and the potential for return of spontaneous facial movement.

39,19050488,Embase,Uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial paralysis,"BACKGROUND: The superficial temporal fascia merits its popularity in reconstructive surgery for its large number of clinical applications. In this report, the authors present their experience with different uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial reanimation. METHODS: Seventeen cases are presented. In 10 patients, the fascial flap provided a vascularized lining at the interface between the free muscle flap for smile restoration and the overlying skin. In six cases, it was utilized to correct small or moderate contour deficits in the paretic hemiface, using either the fascial flap alone or in combination with free adipose tissue. One patient presented with facial paralysis and Frey syndrome following parotidectomy, and the fascial flap was used to control gustatory sweating. Five independent observers graded aesthetic and functional outcomes on a scale from poor to excellent. Three patients were lost to follow-up, so 14 cases were evaluated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months (47 ¬¨¬± 60.49 months). The specific reconstructive goal for each patient was achieved and the overall symmetry was greatly improved, with all patients being granted higher scores by the panel of observers following the superficial fascia flap (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks, p < 0.0001). Transient or permanent alopecia along the temporal incision was the main complication observed. CONCLUSIONS: Transfer of the superficial temporal fascia flap is a valuable technique with several potential applications in facial paralysis management and reconstructive surgery in general. The advantages of this highly vascularized, gliding, and pliable flap far outweigh the associated minimal complications. ¬¨¬© 2008 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,0,10.0,9,2,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e31818dc012,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008) 122:6 (176e-185e).

This article presents the results achieved by free functional muscle transplantation for reconstruction of the paralyzed face, registered by three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements. Methods: Of patients treated consecutively between 1997 and 2006, two groups were constituted: group 1 comprised 22 patients with reinnervation completed after a single cross-face nerve graft and a free gracilis muscle graft for reconstruction of the smile; group 2 comprised nine patients treated with two cross-face nerve grafts followed by a territorially differentiated gracilis muscle transplant for reconstruction of the smile and eye closure. Smiling with showing teeth, maximal showing of teeth, and closing the eyes as in sleep were analyzed in detail. Results: In group 1, static asymmetry was reduced from 12.19 +/- 8.73 mm preoperatively to -1.84 +/- 7.67 mm at 18 months postoperatively. Smile amplitude increased from 9 to 60 percent of that on the healthy side in 10 incomplete facial palsies of this group, and from 0 to 62 percent in eight functionally successful muscle grafts among 11 patients with complete lesions. In group 2, static asymmetry improved from 7.24 +/- 12.64 mm to -5.36 +/- 9.07 mm; the overcorrection was intentional. Movement was improved in eight cases. Smile amplitude reached 68 +/- 43 percent of that on the normal side. Lagophthalmus improved from 7.21 +/- 3.59 mm to 1.38 +/- 2.49 mm. All improvements were statistically significant (p <or= 0.05).

41,19050524,Embase,Use of mini-temporalis transposition to improve free muscle outcomes for smile,"BACKGROUND: In managing late facial paralysis, association of cross-facial nerve grafting and free muscle transfer proves superior to any other method of mid-face reanimation. Nevertheless, predicting functional recovery remains a struggle, and in a minority of patients, results are deceiving. In this study, cases of fair or moderate outcomes from a free muscle transfer received a segmental temporalis transposition to upgrade the functional and aesthetic results. METHODS: From 1981 to 2007, 153 patients received a free muscle transfer for smile restoration in the authors' center. Of all patients, 72 percent (110 patients) required a third stage of revisions. In 41 cases, mini-temporalis transfer was used to augment moderate outcomes of a free muscle transfer. The exclusion criterion was less than 3 months' follow-up; thus, six patients were not evaluated. Each patient was videotaped at three successive time points (preoperatively, following free muscle transfer, and following mini-temporalis transfer). Five independent observers graded patients' videos using a five-category scale from poor to excellent. RESULTS: In all of the patients, the averaged scores were higher after free muscle transfer in comparison with the preoperative scores (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0001). After mini-temporalis transfer, 97.1 percent of the patients had scores that were increased further and 2.8 percent had the same scores. Alopecia along the coronal incision was seen in four patients, and hollowing of the infratemporal fossa was seen in five.

42,19319050,Pub-med,"The ""babysitter"" procedure: minihypoglossal to facial nerve transfer and cross-facial nerve grafting","Background: In 1984, Terzis introduced the ""babysitter"" procedure, a new concept in facial reanimation. It involves two stages, with coaptation of ipsilateral 40 percent hypoglossal to facial nerve on the affected side, performed concomitantly with cross-facial nerve grafting and secondary microcoaptations 8 to 15 months later. This article presents the senior author's (J.K.T.) experience with the original procedure. Methods: Of 75 patients who had minihypoglossal nerve transfer, 20 fulfilled the selection criteria for the original babysitter procedure. All patients' records, photographs, videotapes, and needle electromyography studies were reviewed. The clinical results were scored using Terzis' Grading Scale. Eye closure, smile, and lower lip depression were each assessed separately. Functional and aesthetic outcomes and preoperative and postoperative electromyography results were analyzed. Results: Seventy-five percent of patients achieved excellent and good results, 15 percent had moderate results, and 10 percent had fair results. The difference between preoperative and postoperative eye closure was statistically significant (t test, p < 0.001). Symmetrical smile and full contraction (excellent result) was achieved in two patients (10 percent), 13 patients (65 percent) had nearly symmetrical smile (good result), and five patients (25 percent) had a moderate result. Two patients (10 percent) had full lower lip depression (excellent result) and 15 (75 percent) had good results. In three patients (15 percent), subsequent digastric or platysma muscle transfer was performed because of inadequate depression and symmetry (moderate result). A statistically significant difference was observed between preoperative and postoperative electromyography results, in eye closure, smile, and lower lip depression.

43,19319051,Embase,Long-term outcomes of free-muscle transfer for smile restoration in adults,"BACKGROUND:: The cross-facial nerve grafting/free-muscle transfer strategy for smile restoration is superior to static reconstruction or regional muscle transposition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this technique in adult patients. METHODS:: Eighty-one adult patients received a free-muscle transfer for midface reanimation in the authors' center. Of this group, the authors identified 24 cases with follow-up of 5 years or longer. Smile symmetry and function were evaluated at three points: preoperatively, early postoperatively, and at long-term follow-up. To better evaluate the effect of time, patients were divided into groups according to the length of follow-up: group A, 5 to 6 years; group B, 7 to 10 years; group C, 11 to 15 years; and group D, more than 15 years. Four independent observers rated each patient's smile using a five-category scale ranging from poor to excellent. Panelists were asked to comment on whether the patient's smile weakened over time. RESULTS:: All patients obtained higher scores at 2 years from free-muscle transfer in comparison with their preoperative rates (p < 0.0001). Late outcomes demonstrated that muscle regeneration continues beyond the initial 2 years, with a further increase of the scores and motor units on electromyography at the late follow-up (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0313). No significance was found when comparing both variables among the four groups, indicating that time does not have a differential effect on muscle function. In 80 percent of the evaluations, the four observers agreed on maintained smile symmetry over time. CONCLUSIONS:: Cross-facial nerve grafting/free-muscle transfer is an effective technique for smile restoration in late facial paralysis. These data indicate maintenance of effective muscle function and progressive improvement with time.

Study design: Case series. Methods/results: One-stage bilateral gracilis transfer was performed in three patients with bilateral facial paralysis. Muscle transplants produced a meaningful smile in all transferred muscles. All patients reported improved speech and decreased drooling. Conclusions: Bilateral gracilis transplants with reconstruction of the oral commissure is a realistic option in management of the bilaterally paralyzed face. In this small series, it appears to improve oral competence, restore smiling, and contribute favorably to lower lip support. This technique has been made more feasible because the operative time for free tissue transfer has continuously declined with the use of two-team surgery, improved microsurgical techniques, and the advent of venous coupling devices.",0,,1,0,0.0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.otohns.2009.03.005,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2009 Jul;141(1):139-41. doi: 10.1016/j.otohns.2009.03.005.,"Lindsay RW, Hadlock TA, Cheney ML.",2009,19559974,"Tools: clinical evaluation Outcomes: smile, oral competence, lower lip support",3.0,2.0,6.0,25.67,10.0,39.0,3.0,24.0,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
45,19568051,Embase,Single-stage facial reanimation in the surgical treatment of unilateral established facial paralysis,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of unilateral long-standing facial paralysis requires transposition of new musculature to restore the function of the atrophied mimetic musculature. Facial reanimation with free neuromuscular flaps is actually the accepted standard treatment. Two-stage procedures have been used for years, with a total flap recovery time of 18 to 24 months. In 1998, Harii proposed single-stage facial reanimation using the latissimus dorsi flap, showing a faster recovery compared with two-stage procedures. The present study evaluated the results of the authors' center applying the single-stage facial reanimation. METHODS: From April of 1999 to April of 2006, 33 patients with unilateral established facial paralysis underwent single-stage facial reanimation via latissimus dorsi free flap transplantation. Time from the onset of paralysis ranged from 20 months to 64 years (mean, 11.6 years). Patients were followed postoperatively for at least 24 months. Results were studied and compared using Terzis and Noah's 1997 classification. RESULTS: Among the 33 patients included in the study, there was an average reinnervation time of 8.9 months. According to Terzis and Noah's classification system, 12 patients (36.3 percent) were considered grade V, 12 (36.3 percent) were grade IV, four (12.2 percent) were grade III, two (6.1 percent) were grade II, and three (9.1 percent) were grade I. CONCLUSIONS: Single-stage facial reanimation with a latissimus dorsi flap achieved morphofunctional results similar to those obtained with the classic two-stage technique. In addition, the authors were able to reduce the morbidity associated with treatment and the time required for recovery. ¬¨¬© 2009 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,0,9.0,9,2,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181aa0e2b,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009) 124:1 (124-133).

46,19571737,Embase,Muscle transplants for facial reanimation: Rationale and results of insertion technique using the palmaris longus tendon,"Thirty-one patients with unilateral long-standing facial palsy underwent 1-stage reanimation with free gracilis muscle transplant innervated by the masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve. They were divided into 2 nonrandomized groups according to insertion technique: group I (9 patients), interrupted suture between the free flap and the orbicularis oris of the upper and lower lip on the paralyzed side; group II (22 patients), palmaris longus tendon graft placed between the gracilis free flap and the orbicularis oris of the upper and lower lip on the nonparalyzed side. Qualitative evaluation of the smile demonstrated better results in patients from group II. Comparing the position of the Cupid's bow at rest, pre- and postoperatively in each patient, we observed significant improvement of facial symmetry in both groups. During smile, however, there was a significantly higher rate of centralization of the Cupid's bow in patients submitted to reanimation with the use of the palmaris longus tendon (group II). ¬¨¬© 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",0,,2,0,10.0,9,8,3,0,10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181893867,Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009) 63:2 (148-152).

47,19935298,Embase,"""babysitter"" procedure with concomitant muscle transfer in facial paralysis","BACKGROUND:: The ""babysitter"" procedure combines cross-facial nerve grafting with segmental transfer of the hypoglossal to the affected facial nerve. Introduced by Terzis in 1984, the technique can produce satisfactory to excellent results. In long-lasting paralysis, nonetheless, the babysitter procedure may need to be combined with a muscle(s) flap(s) for outcome upgrading, which was the focus of the present study. METHODS:: Thirty-eight patients had the babysitter procedure over a 20-year period (1984 to 2003). Twenty patients had only the babysitter procedure, whereas 18 needed an additional muscle flap(s) (up to three) to enhance function and cosmesis. These muscles included nine free (gracilis, pectoralis minor) and 20 regional (frontalis, minitemporalis, platysma, digastric) muscles for distinct target needs: eye closure, smile restoration, and lower lip depression. The need for a muscle flap was determined at the initial consultation. All free muscles were transferred at the second-stage of the babysitter procedure, whereas regional muscles were also transposed later. Three independent observers graded the results at two time intervals, preoperatively and 2 years after all operations were completed. RESULTS:: The average postoperative grading scores were significantly higher compared with preoperative scores for eye closure, smile, lower lip depression, and overall aesthetic outcome (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). All patients had upgrading of overall aesthetics and smile, whereas four maintained similar scoring for eye closure and one maintained similar scoring for lip depression. All but two had secondary procedures to further enhance facial symmetry. CONCLUSION:: The babysitter procedure in conjunction with muscle transfers in selected patients with late presentation can provide highly satisfactory results when seeking uncompromising outcome.

48,19944241,Embase,Facial animation in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes,"Background: Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of varying severity, involves multiple cranial nerves and is characterized predominantly by bilateral or unilateral paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves. The paralysis of the VI and VII cranial nerves leads to a lack of function in the muscles they supply. Facial paralysis often causes bilabial incompetence with speech difficulties, oral incompetence, problems with eating and drinking, including pocketing of food in the cheek and dribbling, as well as severe drooling. Methods: In this study, we report on pediatric patients with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes seen and treated surgically from 2003 to September 2007 at the Operative Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery, Head and Neck Department, University of Parma, Italy. Results: Twelve patients underwent microsurgical reconstruction for restoration of facial movement. The contralateral facial nerve was used as a motor donor nerve in 4 procedures, the motor nerve to the masseter muscle was used in 8 patients, and the gracilis muscle was used in all operations, with a total of 17 free-muscle transplantations. All free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. We observed a significant improvement in drooling, drinking, speech, and facial animation with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Conclusions: The gracilis muscle free transfer is a surgical procedure well tolerated by the young patients and well accepted by their families. We consider it a safe and reliable technique for facial reanimation with good aesthetical and functional results in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes. ¬¨¬© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

49,19952645,Pub-med,Outcomes of mini-hypoglossal nerve transfer and direct muscle neurotization for restoration of lower lip function in facial palsy,"Background: Most reconstructions for lower lip palsy focus on paralyzing the contralateral normal lip or providing static support on the affected side. The authors' unit has reported dynamic strategies for lower lip reanimation and use of 40 percent of the hypoglossal nerve (mini-hypoglossal) in facial reanimation. They report their experience with mini-hypoglossal nerve transfer for lower lip palsy. Methods: Between 1987 and 2005, 29 patients with unilateral facial palsy had lower lip reanimation with the mini-hypoglossal as the motor donor. Twenty patients had transfer of the mini-hypoglossal to the cervicofacial branch of the facial nerve and nine had direct depressor muscle neurotization. Five patients had a mean denervation time of 14.60 +/- 4.50 months (<2 years), and the rest had a mean denervation time of 10.63 +/- 9.23 years. In late cases, the facial nerve was in-continuity, and preoperative needle electromyographs of depressors showed at least fibrillations. Standardized videos taken preoperatively and at 2 years postoperatively were available for 27 patients and assessed by three independent reviewers. Needle electromyographic results were analyzed. Results: Thirteen patients (48.15 percent) achieved excellent and good results, nine (33.33 percent) had moderate results, and five (18.52 percent) obtained fair results. The difference between the averaged preoperative and postoperative scores was statistically significant, as was the difference in electromyographic outcomes (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The nerve transfer and direct neurotization groups had no statistically significant difference in clinical and electromyographic outcomes. Four patients required muscle transfer for further outcome upgrading. Conclusion: Use of the mini-hypoglossal either for nerve transfer or for direct muscle neurotization of lower lip depressors can provide reinnervation and satisfactory clinical function, even for muscles with prolonged partial denervation.",3,,0,1,0.0,2,6,3,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181bf81f6,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2009 Dec;124(6):1891-1904. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181bf81f6.,"Terzis JK, Tzafetta K.",2009,19952645,Tools: Clinical evaluation EMG Outcomes: comparisson of measurements preop vs postop,27.0,,,,,,,,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
50,20009835,Pub-med,Outcomes of direct muscle neurotization in pediatric patients with facial paralysis,"Background: Multistage reconstructive procedures are often required to try to restore the emotional potential of human expression in cases of facial paralysis. In this study, the senior author's (J.K.T.) experience with the technique of direct nerve to muscle neurotization as a part of multistage facial reanimation procedures is presented. Age, denervation time, etiology of the lesion, previous reconstructive procedures, and types of muscles responsible for animation were analyzed to make evidence-based recommendations on the indications of the technique as well as its role and effectiveness in facial reanimation. Methods: Retrospective review of 37 pediatric patients who underwent direct muscle neurotization took place. The patients were divided into three groups, depending on the region that direct neurotization was aiming to augment. Group A involved 28 patients for eye closure and blink, group B included 15 patients for smile, and group C included 19 patients for depressor augmentation. Results: Twenty patients were female and 17 male. Patient age ranged from 1 to 16 years, with a mean age (+/-SD) of 9 +/- 2.8 years. Denervation time ranged from 3 months to 15.25 years, and the mean denervation time was 6.72 years. Electromyographic scoring of the neurotized muscles showed an overall mean improvement of 36 percent for eye closure, 34.25 percent for blink, 37 percent for smile augmentation, and 30 percent for depressor function restoration.

Facial reanimation in such patients restores the ability of some motion and of limited emotional expression. In one-fourth of these patients, hypoglossal involvement results in severe speech impairment due to tongue atrophy and lack of voluntary mobility. Bilabial incompetence due to facial paralysis further deteriorates speech capability. Direct tongue neurotization has been used by the senior author (J.K.T) to improve tongue function and speech intelligibility in patients with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome. This study presents the senior author's experience with the technique as a component of multistage facial reanimation procedures. Methods: Data collection was performed by retrospective review on six patients with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome who underwent direct tongue neurotization. In addition, each patient was videotaped for 30 minutes preoperatively and postoperatively according to a standardized protocol. Results: Four independent investigators scored speech intelligibility in each patient using a standardized grading system. The results showed considerable improvement in speech intelligibility and articulation. Higher improvement was noted in patients with partial bilateral hypoglossal involvement than in patients with complete unilateral involvement of the hypoglossal nerve, as well as in younger ages. No difference was noted between sexes. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study presenting the effect of direct tongue neurotization on speech intelligibility in patients with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome.

52,20417006,Embase,Facial Animation With Free-Muscle Transfer Innervated by the Masseter Motor Nerve in Unilateral Facial Paralysis,"Purpose: Facial paralysis is a congenital or acquired disorder of varying severity leading to an asymmetric or absent facial expression. It represents an important debilitation from both esthetic and functional points of view. In this article we report our experience with patients treated with gracilis muscle transplantation innervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. We discuss the surgical technique and the functional and esthetic results and evaluate the effectiveness of this donor nerve in providing adequate innervation to the muscle transfer for lower facial reanimation. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with unilateral facial paralysis were seen and surgically treated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy, between 2003 and 2007. In this study we report on 8 cases treated with gracilis muscle transfer reinnervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. Results: In this series all free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. Facial symmetry at rest and while smiling was excellent or good in all patients, and we observed a significant improvement in speech and oral competence. With practice, the majority of patients developed the ability to smile spontaneously and without jaw movement. Conclusions: We consider the masseter motor nerve a powerful and reliable donor nerve, allowing us to obtain a commissure and upper lip movement similar to those of the normal site for amount and direction. This is why we think that there may be a larger role for the masseter motor nerve for innervation of patients with unilateral facial paralysis who would otherwise have been considered candidates for cross-facial nerve graft innervation of the muscle transfer. ¬¨¬© 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",2,,1,3,0.0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.joms.2009.09.024,Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010) 68:7 (1524-1529).

53,20595861,Pub-med,Novel use of C7 spinal nerve for Moebius,"Background: The purpose of this study was to introduce the use of selective ipsilateral C7 spinal nerve transfer to the armamentarium of the dynamic procedures used for facial reanimation in Moebius patients. Methods: Between 1991 and 2007, the selective ipsilateral C7 technique was used in four patients. In three patients with bilateral paralysis, both C7 spinal nerves were utilized as nerve donors. Thus, evaluation of outcomes was carried out in seven hemifaces. Results: Short-term paresthesia on the index pulp of the donor upper extremity was observed in four limbs, which recovered spontaneously. Motor deficits were never noticed. Neurotization of the free-muscle transfer for smile was performed in five hemifaces, with good results in three hemifaces (p < 0.01, z = 2.61). Eye closure neurotization was made in six hemifaces, with good results in four hemifaces (p < 0.01, z = 2.88). Depressor neurotization was made in one case and resulted in improved depressor complex function. In two cases of free muscle transfer for masseter substitution, electromyographic interpretations revealed full motor activity after bilateral latissimus dorsi transfer. Tongue neurotization was performed in two instances. Postoperatively, the patients' speech intelligibility improved as well as tongue motility and bulk. Conclusion: The use of the C7 as a motor donor in Moebius cases with multicranial nerve involvement supplies the typical mask-like face with an abundance of motor fibers for facial reanimation and, if there is a coexisting twelfth nerve palsy, for speech restoration.",0,,2,1,9.0,9,8,3,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181dbbd79,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2010 Jul;126(1):106-117. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181dbbd79.,"Terzis JK, Konofaos P.",2010,20595861,,7.0,,,,,,,,Multiple nerve grafts:nerve transfer,,no nerve transfer,,,['Latissimus dorsi flap'],Latissimus dorsi flap,,
54,20595863,Pub-med,Blink restoration in adult facial paralysis,"Background: Impaired eyelid function in facial paralysis patients is a serious disability that can even threaten vision. Eye reanimation techniques and specifically blink restoration reinstates the cornea's protective mechanism and recovers a more natural appearance and eye function. Both dynamic and static procedures have been used to augment eye closure, but only dynamic procedures can lead to blink restoration. In this study, the experience of a single surgeon (J.K.T.) with dynamic procedures addressing the challenge of blink restoration is presented. Methods: A retrospective review of 95 adult patients who underwent dynamic procedures for blink restoration was performed. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 75) included patients who underwent nerve transfers, including cross-facial nerve grafting and subsequent microcoaptations, mini-hypoglossal nerve transfers, and direct orbicularis oculi muscle neurotization. Group B (n = 20) included patients who underwent eye sphincter substitution procedures, including pedicled frontalis or mini-temporalis transfers, free platysma, occipitalis, gracilis subunits, extensor digitorum brevis, and a slip of adductor longus transfer. Objective blink ratios were measured according to a protocol established by the senior author (J.K.T.). Results: The patients included 34 men and 61 women. Mean age was 34.9 +/- 9.8 years. Denervation time ranged from 7 months to 42.12 years, and the mean denervation time was 13.02 years. Blink improvement was noted in all of the patients.

55,20643594,Embase,Outcomes of direct muscle neurotisation in adult facial paralysis,"Fifty-seven adult patients with facial paralysis, who underwent direct muscle neurotisation, were reviewed and divided into three categories depending on the function that direct neurotisation was aiming to augment. Group 1 included 30 patients who underwent direct neurotisation for eye closure and blink, group 2 consisted of 23 patients for smile augmentation, and group 3 comprised 31 patients for depressor. The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 74 years. Denervation time (Dt) ranged from 8 months to 42 years. Eight patients had partial facial paralysis, and 49 patients had complete facial paralysis. The results were based on the functional and electromyography (EMG) scoring of the neurotised muscles showing an overall EMG mean improvement of 26.56% in eye closure, 34.47% in smile restoration and 32.67% in depressor function by the procedure. Median improvement in all facial functions was one grade (25%) in theTerzis grading systems regarding the respective facial functions. The prerequisites are Dt less than 6 months and a functional contralateral facial nerve. In cases where Dt is more than 27 months and preoperative EMG's are silent, a free or pedicled muscle should be used to substitute the denervated native facial muscle. Promoting expressivity and augmenting facial muscle function using direct muscle neurotisation are important components in facial reanimation. ¬¨¬© 2010 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

The purpose of this study is to report on a series for dynamic reinnervation of the paralyzed face by using a split 12-7 nerve transposition. The goals of this procedure are to minimize tongue morbidity and to provide good facial reinnervation. Methods: Prospective case series. Melolabial crease discursion, overall facial movement, and degree of tongue atrophy and mobility were recorded. Results: Thirteen patients underwent facial reanimation using a split hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer with postoperative follow-up to 58 months (range, 6-58 months). All patients achieved excellent rest symmetry and facial tone. Of 13 patients, 10 had measurable coordinated movement and discursion of their melolabial crease. Of 13 patients, 12 had mild to moderate ipsilateral tongue atrophy. The mean time to onset of visible reinnervation was 3 months.

The respective final results for patients in groups A and B who already showed the onset of flap contraction were excellent in 28.6% and 44.5%, good in 42.9% and 33.3%, moderate in 10.7% and 22.2%, and fair or poor and fair in 17.8% and 0% of patients, respectively.

Methods: We report a case series of 17 consecutive patients with facial paralysis who underwent minimally invasive temporalis tendon transposition surgery for dynamic facial reanimation between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. The minimally invasive technique is described. Preoperative and postoperative records, photographs, and videos were reviewed for feasibility of the technique, symmetry, oral competence, and dynamic oral commissure movement. Results: All the patients tolerated the procedure well, and none developed procedure-related complications. All the patients achieved improved symmetry at rest and voluntary motion of the oral commissure. In all the patients, the temporalis tendon was transposed to the modiolus without the need for fascial extension or lengthening myoplasty. Conclusions: The temporalis tendon can be transposed for immediate dynamic reanimation of the paralyzed lower face using a minimally invasive approach. This procedure involves a single small incision and minimal dissection, with no major osteotomies.

60,21558933,Embase,Smile reconstruction through bilateral muscular transplants neurotized by hypoglossal nerves,"Free transplant of gracilis muscle is the criterion-standard technique in dynamic rehabilitation of long-standing facial paralysis in which the facial musculature is atrophied. When the facial nerve is not available because of a bilateral lesion, other sources are the masseteric, hypoglossal, or accessory nerves. Although the use of hypoglossal nerve has been relegated to the background because of the morbidity caused by its loss, there are special situations in which the hypoglossal nerve should be considered the first option as donor motor nerve. The present article discusses the case of a patient with dynamic reanimation of bilateral facial paralysis with free-muscle transfer neurotized to the hypoglossal nerve. End-to-side coaptation of gracilis motor nerve and hypoglossal motor nerve allows neurotization of the transplanted muscle with minimum repercussion in speech or swallowing and can provide an adequate spontaneous smile with time.

We sought to quantify smile excursion and quality-of-life (QOL) changes in our pediatric free gracilis recipients following reanimation. Methods: We quantified gracilis muscle excursion in 17 pediatric patients undergoing 19 consecutive pediatric free gracilis transplantation operations, using our validated SMILE program, as an objective measure of functional outcome. These were compared against excursion measured the same way in a cohort of 17 adults with 19 free gracilis operations. In addition, we prospectively evaluated QOL outcomes in these children using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) instrument. Results: The mean gracilis excursion in our pediatric free gracilis recipients was 8.8 mm ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 5.0 mm, which matched adult results, but with fewer complete failures of less than 2-mm excursion, with 2 (11%) and 4 (21%), respectively. Quality-of-life measures indicated statistically significant improvements following dynamic smile reanimation (P = .01). Conclusions: Dynamic facial reanimation using free gracilis transfer in children has an acceptable success rate, yields improved commissure excursion, and improves QOL in the pediatric population.

62,21841532,Pub-med,Treatment of facial paralysis: dynamic reanimation of spontaneous facial expression-apropos of 655 patients,"Background: Six hundred fifty-five cases of unilateral facial paralysis were treated by different surgical methods to achieve dynamic reanimation of facial muscle movement. In a retrospective study, the recovery of both truly spontaneous smile and facial muscle movement was evaluated independently. Methods: The authors performed 505 two-stage gracilis, one rectus abdominis, and 14 single-stage latissimus dorsi microneurovascular muscle transfers, in addition to 28 cross-facial facial nerve neurotization procedures. These procedures were based on neurotization of the paralyzed region by the contralateral healthy facial nerve. Procedures involving motor nerves or muscle beyond the territory of the facial nerve included 73 temporalis muscle transpositions, four lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedures, 26 neurotizations by the hypoglossal nerve, and four neurotizations by the spinal accessory nerve. Results: Patients treated by techniques based on the motor function of nerves other than the facial nerve did not recover spontaneous smile. Neurotization by the facial nerve, however, did result in the recovery of spontaneous smile in all satisfactory or better outcomes. Recovery of lip commissure movement based on neurotization by the contralateral healthy facial nerve was better than that of the remaining groups (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Temporalis muscle transposition and lengthening myoplasty are acceptable options for patients who are not good candidates for neurotization by the facial nerve. For the restoration of both truly spontaneous smile and facial muscle movement, free microneurovascular muscle transfer neurotized by the contralateral healthy facial nerve has become the authors' first-choice surgical technique.

Methods: Disrupted buccal branches provided a recipient facial nerve for 24 gracilis reinnervations. An additional 15 free flaps were used for extensive composite defects. Smile outcome was graded according to Terzis' criteria after 2 years of recurrence-free follow-up. The effects of postoperative radiotherapy, integrity of the oral commissure, and double free flaps were compared. Results: Eighteen patients completed 2 years' recurrence-free follow-up; average smile outcome was Terzis grade 4 (mean, 3.8). Resection/reconstruction of the modiolus (five of 18 patients) tended to diminish outcome (Terzis grade 3, mean, 3.0; median, 3; versus Terzis grade 4, mean, 4.1; median, 5) compared with two free flaps performed simultaneously(mean, 3.56 versus 4.14; median, 3 versus 5). Postoperative radiotherapy (eight of 18 patients) had a more modest effect on outcome (Terzis grade 3, mean, 3.3; Terzis grade 4, mean, 4.1; median, 3 versus 5).

All patients had unilateral facial paralysis, and were candidates for surgical masseteric to facial nerve anastomosis. Two patient groups were measured: seven patients were waiting for surgery, the other seven patients had already been submitted to surgery, and had regained facial mimicry. Each patient performed three facial animations: brow raise; free smile; lip purse. These were recorded using an optoelectronic motion analyser. The three-dimensional coordinates of facial landmarks were obtained, their movements were computed, and asymmetry indices calculated (differential movements between the two hemi-faces: healthy and paretic/rehabilitated). Before surgery, mobility was larger in the healthy than in the paretic side; after surgery, the differences were reduced (brow raise and lip purse), or even reversed (smile). Before surgery, lip purse was performed with significant labial asymmetry (p=0.042; larger healthy side movement). After surgery, asymmetry indices reduced. Total labial asymmetry during smiling was significantly different from 0 before surgery (p=0.018, larger healthy side movement). After surgery, all asymmetry indices became non-significant.

Herein, we present a modification in temporalis muscle transfer for lower facial reanimation. Instead of the traditional stripping of the temporalis muscle from its origin, its insertion is stripped from the coronoid process through an intraoral approach. The detached fibers were then sutured to a fascia lata graft, which was passed and secured to the orbicularis oris to reanimate the corner of the mouth. The procedure is less extensive and provides a direct ""orthodromic"" line of pull with good muscular excursion and power. This simple procedure has been applied to 12 consecutive cases with long-standing complete facial paralysis presenting to the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Clinic at the Ain-Shams University Hospital over the past 2 years. In addition to symmetry at rest, this easy procedure allowed for good movement of the corner of the mouth with restoration of a balanced smile.",0,,2,3,0.0,9,4,1,0,10.1055/s-0030-1249370,Craniomaxillofac Trauma Reconstr. 2010 Mar;3(1):17-23. doi: 10.1055/s-0030-1249370.,"Elbarbary AS, Hemeda M, Amr AH.",2010,22110814,"Tools: clinical evaluation Outcomes: pt. satisfaction, physician graded, facial movement, oral commissure,",12.0,,,,,,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,['Fascia flap'],Fascia lata,,
66,22310454,Pub-med,Recovery of emotional smiling function in free-flap facial reanimation,"Purpose: Long-standing unilateral facial palsy is treated primarily with free-flap surgery using the masseteric or contralateral facial nerve as a motor source. The use of a gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve restores the smiling function, without obtaining spontaneity. Because emotional smiling is an important factor in facial reanimation, the facial nerve must serve as the motor source to achieve this fundamental target. Materials and methods: From October 1998 to October 2009, 50 patients affected by long-standing unilateral facial paralysis underwent single-stage free-flap reanimation procedures to recover smiling function. A latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve was transplanted in 40 patients, and a gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve in 10 patients. All patients underwent a clinical examination that analyzed voluntary and spontaneous smiling. Results: All patients who received a latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve and recovered muscle function (92.5%) showed voluntary and spontaneous smiling abilities. All patients who received a gracilis free flap innervated by the masseteric nerve recovered function, but only 1 (10%) showed occasional spontaneous flap activation. During those rare activations, much less movement was visible on the operated side than when the patient was asked to smile voluntarily. Conclusions: The masseteric nerve is a powerful motor source that guarantees free voluntary gracilis muscle activation; however, it does not guarantee any spontaneous smiling. Single-stage procedures that use a latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve have a lower success rate and obtain less movement; however, spontaneous smiling is always observed.",2,,1,0,0.0,2,8,1,0,10.1016/j.joms.2011.11.031,J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2012 Oct;70(10):2413-8. doi: 10.1016/j.joms.2011.11.031.

67,22431814,Pub-med,Simultaneous anterolateral thigh flap and temporalis tendon transfer to optimize facial form and function after radical parotidectomy,"Background Extirpation of aggressive parotid or cutaneous facial tumors often involves facial nerve sacrifice and the creation of a large soft-tissue defect. We describe a method for single-stage reconstruction during radical parotidectomy to restore facial form and function without additional morbidity. Methods We conducted a review of immediate reconstruction/reanimation of radical parotidectomy defects with the use of anterolateral thigh (ALT) fat and fascia flaps for facial contouring, orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer (OTTT), cable grafting of the facial nerve, and fascia lata lower lip suspension. Results Five patients (mean age, 67.4 years) underwent extirpation of malignant tumors with facial nerve sacrifice resulting in large soft-tissue deficits. All patients had ALT free tissue transfer to correct facial contour defects and OTTT to restore facial form and function. Four patients underwent cable grafting of facial nerve branches. Branches of the motor nerve to the vastus lateralis harvested from the ALT surgical site were used for cable nerve grafting in 3 patients. Fascia lata from the same ALT harvest site was used for lower lip suspension to the OTTT in 4 patients. There were no donor site complications. All patients achieved miDFacial symmetry at rest, oral competence with dynamic corner-of-mouth movement, and full eye closure. Conclusions Tumor clearance, symmetric facial appearance, as well as dynamic facial rehabilitation were accomplished in a single-stage procedure using the method described herein. The ALT free flap provides versatile options for soft-tissue defects as well as access to motor nerves optimal for grafting without additional morbidity.

68,22451794,Pub-med,Outcomes of Direct Facial-to-Hypoglossal Neurorrhaphy with Parotid Release,"Lesions of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle and their management can result in facial nerve paralysis. When the nerve deficit is not amenable to primary end-to-end repair or interpositional grafting, nerve transposition can be used to accomplish the goals of restoring facial tone, symmetry, and voluntary movement. The most widely used nerve transposition is the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastamosis, of which there are several technical variations. Previously we described a technique of single end-to-side anastamosis using intratemporal facial nerve mobilization and parotid release. This study further characterizes the results of this technique with a larger patient cohort and longer-term follow-up. The design of this study is a retrospective chart review and the setting is an academic tertiary care referral center. Twenty-one patients with facial nerve paralysis from proximal nerve injury at the cerebellopontine angle underwent facial-hypoglossal neurorraphy with parotid release. Outcomes were assessed using the Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and patient photographs. Of the 21 patients, 18 were successfully reinnervated to a score of a B or C on the recovery scale, which equates to good oral and ocular sphincter closure with minimal mass movement. The mean duration of paralysis between injury and repair was 12.1 months (range 0 to 36 months) with a mean follow-up of 55 months. There were no cases of hemiglossal atrophy, paralysis, or subjective dysfunction. Direct facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with parotid release achieved a functional reinnervation and good clinical outcome in the majority of patients, with minimal lingual morbidity. This technique is a viable option for facial reanimation and should be strongly considered as a surgical option for the paralyzed face.",3,,0,0,1.0,9,8,1,0,10.1055/s-0030-1261263,Skull Base. 2011 Jan;21(1):7-12. doi: 10.1055/s-0030-1261263.,"Jacobson J, Rihani J, Lin K, Miller PJ, Roland JT Jr.",2011,22451794,"Tools: clinical evaluation, pt. satisfaction questionnaire, Facial Nerve Recovery Scale Outcomes: first contraction, tongue mobility, degree of atrophy,",21.0,,,,,,,,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,

Methods: From 1978 to 2006, 60 adult patients underwent facial reanimation for facial paralysis following tumor extirpation. There was one patient with bilateral facial paralysis. Thus, evaluation was carried out in 61 hemifaces. Three independent assessors evaluated the preoperative and postoperative videos using the Terzis grading scale for eye closure, smile, depressor, and overall aesthetic and functional outcomes. Preoperative and postoperative electromyographic interpretations and the effect of demographic variables were also evaluated. Results: There was significant improvement regarding preoperative versus postoperative outcomes for overall aesthesis and function. Good and excellent results were observed in 72.14 percent of the hemifaces (n = 44). The difference between preoperative and postoperative electromyographic results was of statistical significance (p < 0.0001) for each target reinnervated.

The authors present their experience with this procedure and analyze the postoperative complications and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Methods: From March of 1990 to March of 2010, 45 patients underwent the free abductor hallucis muscle transfer procedure in the authors' department. Forty-one were followed up for 54.6 months (range, 28 months to 17 years). The Toronto Facial Grading System and Facial Nerve Function Index were used to evaluate facial nerve function at 2 years after surgery and last follow-up. Complications and function of the donor foot were analyzed. Results: No postoperative mortality was found. Complications occurred in four of 41 patients, including muscle loss, infection, hematoma, and hypertrophic scar. The others obtained satisfactory symmetric faces in the static state and in voluntary contraction of the transferred muscles. Mean values for the Toronto Facial Grading System (50.6¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±7.8) and the Facial Nerve Function Index (65.7¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±11.4 percent) were significantly higher at 2 years postoperatively in comparison with preoperative status (21.2¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±5.3 and 19.5¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±3.6 percent, respectively) (p<0.05).

Patients: Four patients with complete facial nerve paralysis due to lesions of the facial nucleus in the pons caused by hemorrhage due to arteriovenous or cavernous venous malformations, stroke, or injury after tumor resection. Intervention: All patients underwent end-to-end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis. Main outcome measures: Facial nerve function using the House-Brackmann (HB) scale and physical and social/well-being function using the facial disability index. Results: The mean age of the patients was 53.3 years (range, 32-73). There were 3 female and 1 male patients. All patients had preoperative facial function HB VI/VI. With a minimum of 12 months' follow-up after end-to-end hypoglossal-facial anastomosis, 75% of patients regained function to HB grade III/VI, and 25% had HB grade IV/VI. Average facial disability index scores were 61.25 for physical function and 78 for social/well-being, comparable to results from complete hypoglossal-facial anastomosis after peripheral facial nerve palsy after acoustic neuroma resection. Conclusion: Patients with nuclear facial paralysis who undergo end-to-end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis achieve similar degrees of reanimation compared with those with peripheral facial nerve palsies. This raises the intriguing possibility that reinnervation may also be of benefit in patients with the vastly more common facial dysfunction because of cortical stroke or injury.",3,,0,0,7.0,9,4,1,0,10.1097/MAO.0b013e3182693cd0,Otol Neurotol. 2012 Oct;33(8):1439-44. doi: 10.1097/MAO.0b013e3182693cd0.,"Corrales CE, Gurgel RK, Jackler RK.",2012,22935815,"Tools:HB score, Physical and social/well-being function using the facial disability index Outcome: facial movement, numbness",4.0,,,,,,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
75,23052376,Pub-med,Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer: is it possible to rehabilitate the function of both the paralyzed eyelid and the oral commissure?,"Background: This report addresses the efficiency of masseter-to-facial nerve transfer and investigates the patient's ability to perform the functions of eyelid closure and smile movements independently. Methods: From November 2010 to January 2012, seven patients underwent the reported procedure and were followed 6 to 12 months postoperatively. The patients' ages varied from 22 to 41 years. The etiology of the injuries was resection of cerebellopontine angle tumors in all the patients. Using Terzis' and Mehta's scale, smile outcomes and synkinetic movements were evaluated pre- and post-operatively. The function of eyelid closure was evaluated by measuring the width of the lagophthalmos. A questionnaire was applied to evaluate ocular problems and donor-site morbidity. Results: All the patients were able to close their eyelids and smile with biting. Four of the seven patients were able to smile effortlessly without biting. According to Terzis' scale, the postoperative mean score was 4.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.8 compared with 1.0 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.0 at the preoperative evaluation. The improvement in the lagophthalmos varied from 2 to 5 mm. The ocular problems all were resolved. All the patients were able to smile easily without eyelid closure and could close their eyes with minimal oral commissure movement. No patients reported weakness of mastication on the affected side, and only minimal atrophy of the masseter muscle at the donor site was noted. Conclusions: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a highly efficient technique for reanimating paralyzed muscle. After physical training, both eyelid closure and smiling are restored and discriminated after physical training.

76,23101452,Embase,Hemihypoglossal nerve transfer for acute facial paralysis: Clinical article,"Object. The authors have developed a technique for the treatment of facial paralysis that utilizes anastomosis of the split hypoglossal and facial nerve. Here, they document improvements in the procedure and experimental evidence supporting the approach. Methods. They analyzed outcomes in 36 patients who underwent the procedure, all of whom had suffered from facial paralysis following the removal of large vestibular schwannomas. The average period of paralysis was 6.2 months. The authors used 5 different variations of a procedure for selecting the split nerve, including evaluation of the split nerve using recordings of evoked potentials in the tongue. Results. Successful facial reanimation was achieved in 16 of 17 patients using the cephalad side of the split hypoglossal nerve and in 15 of 15 patients using the caudal side. The single unsuccessful case using the cephalad side of the split nerve resulted from severe infection of the cheek. Procedures using the ansa cervicalis branch yielded poor success rates (2 of 4 cases). Some tongue atrophy was observed in all variants of the procedure, with 17 cases of minimal atrophy and 14 cases of moderate atrophy. No procedure led to severe atrophy causing functional deficits of the tongue. Conclusions. The split hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis procedure consistently leads to good facial reanimation, and the use of either half of the split hypoglossal nerve results in facial reanimation and moderate tongue atrophy. ¬¨¬©AANS, 2013.",4,,0,0,9.0,9,2,1,0,10.3171/2012.9.JNS1270,Journal of Neurosurgery (2013) 118:1 (160-166).

77,23352449,Embase,Eyelid reanimation with gold weight implant and tendon sling suspension: Evaluation of excursion and velocity using the FACIAL CLIMA system,"Objective: This study aims to analyse the efficacy of static techniques, namely gold weight implant and tendon sling, in the reanimation of the paralytic eyelid. Upper eyelid rehabilitation in terms of excursion and blinking velocity is performed using the automatic motion capture system, FACIAL CLIMA. Methods: Seventy-four patients underwent a total of 101 procedures including 58 upper eyelid gold weight implants and 43 lower eyelid tendon suspension with 27 patients undergoing both procedures. The presence of lagophtalmos, eye dryness, corneal ulcer, epiphora and lower lid ptosis/ectropion was assessed preoperatively. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare preoperative versus postoperative measurements of upper eyelid excursion and blinking velocity determined with FACIAL CLIMA. Significance was set at p <0.05. Results: FACIAL CLIMA revealed significant improvement of eyelid excursion and velocity of blinking (p < 0.001). Eye dryness improved in 49 patients (90.7%) and corneal ulcer resolved without any further treatment in 12 (85.7%) of those with a gold weight inserted. Implant extrusion was observed in 8.6% of the cases. Of the patients with lower lid tendon suspension, correction of ptosis/ectropion and epiphora was achieved in 93.9% and 91.9% of cases, respectively. In eight patients (18.6%), further surgery was needed to adjust tendon tension. Conclusions: The paralytic upper and lower eyelid can be successfully managed with gold weight implant and tendon suspension. The FACIAL CLIMA system is a reliable method to quantify upper eyelid excursion and blinking velocity and to detect the exact position of the lower eyelid. ¬¨¬© 2012 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

78,23416438,Pub-med,Facial reanimation with gracilis muscle transfer neurotized to cross-facial nerve graft versus masseteric nerve: a comparative study using the FACIAL CLIMA evaluating system,"Background: Longstanding unilateral facial paralysis is best addressed with microneurovascular muscle transplantation. Neurotization can be obtained from the cross-facial or the masseter nerve. The authors present a quantitative comparison of both procedures using the FACIAL CLIMA system. Methods: Forty-seven patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis underwent reanimation with a free gracilis transplant neurotized to either a cross-facial nerve graft (group I, n=20) or to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve (group II, n=27). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the FACIAL CLIMA system. Postoperative intragroup commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity means of the reanimated versus the normal side were first compared using the independent samples t test. Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters were compared between the groups using the independent samples t test. Results: Significant differences of mean commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity between the reanimated side and the normal side were observed in group I (p=0.001 and p=0.014, respectively) but not in group II. Intergroup comparisons showed that both commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were higher in group II, with significant differences for commissural displacement (p=0.048). Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters was higher in group II, with significant differences for commissural displacement (p=0.042). Conclusions: Free gracilis muscle transfer neurotized by the masseteric nerve is a reliable technique for reanimation of longstanding facial paralysis. Compared with cross-facial nerve graft neurotization, this technique provides better symmetry and a higher degree of recovery.

79,23511741,Embase,"Facial reanimation by staged, split masseter muscle transfer","BACKGROUND: Facial paralysis of the lower face presents severe functional and aesthetic disturbance to patients. The gamut of facial paralysis correction is diverse and must be tailored to the patient. When nerve repair or free functional muscle transfer is unavailable, regional muscle transfer has become a staple in surgical management of facial paralysis. Previous masseter transfers relied on orbicularis oris attachment, which may be atrophic, adhered, or lengthened. Using fascia lata grafts, we describe the senior author's method of staged, split masseter transfer as a reliable method for reanimating the lower third of the face in appropriate candidates.METHODS: The staged, split masseter muscle transfer is a 3-part repair. The first stage places a hemioral fascia lata graft to act as an anchor reinforcement. The second stage transfers the split masseter muscle, suturing to the fascia lata reinforced oral commissure. The third stage, a reefing procedure, is performed 6 to 10 months later under local anesthesia to reinforce attachments.RESULTS: Six patients underwent the staged, split masseter muscle transfer. Mean age was 43 (15-67) years. Mean time to surgery from onset of deficit was 174 months (3 months to 65 years). All patients had significant improvement over preoperative symptoms. Symmetry was restored in repose. On movement, commissure excursion went from 0 to 6.67 mm in the superolateral vector. Of the 6 patients, 5 required an average of 1.5 outpatient revisions to achieve satisfactory results on average of 4.67 (4-127) months after the final stage.CONCLUSIONS: The staged, split masseter transfer is useful for restoring subtle reanimation in patients presenting with facial paralysis. The staged, split masseter transfer provides bulk and restores both static and dynamic function. We present a case series demonstrating excellent long-term functional results.",0,,2,3,10.0,9,4,1,0,10.1097/SAP.0b013e31826cb267,Annals of plastic surgery (2014) 73:1 (33-38).

80,23684625,Embase,Retrospective study of the functional recovery of men compared with that of women with long-term facial paralysis,"Sex is likely to play an important part in reanimation of the face after paralysis, with women being superior in terms of resistance to neural injury and regeneration. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of the sex of the patient on the recovery of facial paralysis after surgical reanimation by comparing the degree of restored movement between men and women with long-standing paralysis that was reanimated by transfer of the hypoglossal nerve or cross-face nerve grafting. Between 1999 and 2010 we operated on 174 patients with facial paralysis. Of these we studied 26 cases (19 women and 7 men) with complete long-standing paralysis reanimated with either cross-face nerve grafting (n = 14) or transfer of the hemihypoglossal nerve (n = 12). The degree of movement restored was recorded in each case. Statistical analysis showed that in cases with long-standing paralysis women had significantly more movement restored than men for both cross-face nerve grafting (p = 0.02) and hypoglossal transposition (p = 0.04). We conclude that, after a neural injury, women tend to maintain the viability of the facial musculature longer than men, which suggests that they are more resistant to both denervation and the development of muscular atrophy. Whether this phenomenon can be explained by neural or muscular processes, or both, warrants further studies. ¬¨¬© 2013 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",4,,0,0,0.0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.bjoms.2013.04.012,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013) 51:8 (684-688).

81,23806930,Pub-med,Involuntary movement during mastication in patients with long-term facial paralysis reanimated with a partial gracilis free neuromuscular flap innervated by the masseteric nerve,"Background: MiDFace reanimation in patients with chronic facial paralysis is not always possible with an ipsilateral or contralateral facial nerve innervating a free neuromuscular tissue transfer. Alternate use of nonfacial nerves is occasionally indicated but may potentially result in inadvertent motions. The goal of this study was to objectively review videos of patients who underwent one-stage reanimation with a gracilis muscle transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve for (1) inadvertent motion during eating, (2) characterization of masticatory patterns, and (3) social hindrance perceived by the patients during meals. Methods: Between the years 2009 and 2012, 18 patients underwent miDFacial reanimation with partial gracilis muscle transfer coapted to the masseter nerve for treatment of miDFacial paralysis. Sixteen patients were videotaped in detail while eating. Involuntary miDFace movement on the reconstructed side and mastication patterns were assessed. In addition, 16 patients were surveyed as to whether involuntary motion constituted a problem in their daily lives. Results: All 16 patients videotaped during mastication demonstrated involuntary motion on the reconstructed side while eating. Several unique masticatory patterns were noted as well. Only one of the 16 patients reported involuntary motion as a minor disturbance in daily life during meals. Conclusions: All patients with chronic facial paralysis who plan to undergo miDFace reanimation with a free tissue transfer innervated by the ipsilateral masseter nerve should be told that they would universally have involuntary animation during mastication. Most patients do not consider this a major drawback in their daily lives.

82,23806931,Pub-med,One-stage procedure using spinal accessory nerve (XI)-innervated free muscle for facial paralysis reconstruction,"Background: For the treatment of facial paralysis, functioning free muscle transplantation has become accepted standard treatment. Choice of donor nerve and number of surgery stages, however, are still matters of great debate. Methods: Between 2000 and 2011, 36 patients (out of 329; 11 percent) with 42 functioning free muscle transplantations were treated using spinal accessory nerve (XI)-innervated muscle for facial reanimation as a one-stage procedure. Indications included bilateral or unilateral M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome, severe postparetic facial synkinesis, and patient preference. Postoperative smile training was required to achieve spontaneous smile. For outcome assessment, patients were evaluated using multidisciplinary methods, including objective smile excursion score (range, 0 to 4), cortical adaptation stage (range, I to V), tickle test, and subjective patient questionnaire and satisfaction score (range, 1 to 5). Results: Mean smile excursion score improved from 0.5 preoperatively to 3.4 postoperatively. Eighty-three percent of patients were able to perform independent and even spontaneous smile after 1 year of follow-up. Ninety percent of patients had a mean satisfaction score of 3.4 out of 5. However, 50 percent expressed more concern with aesthetic appearance than functional status. There was no functional morbidity of the donor shoulder in daily life. Conclusions: The classic two-stage procedure is still the first choice for facial paralysis reconstruction. However, the effectiveness of XI-innervated free muscle for facial reanimation in a one-stage procedure has proven it to be a good alternative treatment. It has become second in popularity for facial paralysis reconstruction in the authors' center.

The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of movement dissociation and spontaneity of men versus women reanimated with gracilis transfer neurotized to the masseteric nerve. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of 27 patients who underwent facial paralysis reanimation with microvascular gracilis transplants neurotized to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Patients were classified by sex, comparing age at surgery, denervation time, and follow-up, as well as the rates of movement dissociation and smile spontaneity. Results After reanimation with gracilis to masseteric nerve, movement dissociation and spontaneity were higher in women during the first year after onset of facial movement (p'='.02 and p'='.01, respectively). Conclusion After reanimation with masseteric nerve, women seem to be able to smile spontaneously and independently from teeth clenching earlier than men. ¬¨¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84,23935728,Pub-med,Long-term facial nerve function following facial reanimation after translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery: A comparison between sural grafting and VII-XII anastomosis,"The aim of this study was to compare the recovery of long-term facial nerve function between patients who received sural grafts and those who underwent hypoglossal-facial anastomosis techniques following translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery. This study included 25 patients with vestibular schwannomas treated with translabyrinthine tumor removal. All patients had large tumors with a mean tumor size of 3.12 cm. Of these patients, six had progressive tumor enlargement symptoms and had been treated previously with stereotactic irradiation. Preoperatively, all patients had normal facial functions, and total tumor removal with a translabyrinthine approach was achieved in all cases. During surgery, the facial nerve was interrupted in all 25 patients. Two types of facial reanimation were performed. Sural grafts were placed in 13 patients and hypoglossal-facial (VII-XII) anastomosis was performed in the other 12. Facial nerve function and surgical outcomes were observed upon discharge, in the short term (one year following surgery), and in the long term (three years following surgery). Total facial paresis was observed in all patients upon discharge. In the sural graft group, House-Brackmann grade III facial function was achieved in four patients upon short-term evaluation and in ten upon long-term evaluation, while House-Brackmann grade IV facial function was achieved in nine patients upon short-term evaluation and three in the long term. In the VII-XII anastomosis group, House-Brackmann grade III facial function was achieved in two patients in the short term and eight in the long term, and House-Brackmann grade IV facial function was achieved in ten patients in the short term and four in the long term. There was a statistically significant difference in the facial recovery results between the short- and long-term follow-up periods. The sural graft group exhibited a marked improvement in results compared with the VII-XII anastomosis group, but no statistically significant difference in facial function was observed between the two facial reanimation groups at either the short- or long-term follow-up. In the sural graft group, synkinesia, noted in three patients, was the most frequently observed complication. Claudication was common upon discharge (four patients), but diminished during follow-up. Disarticulation was the most common complication in the VII-XII anastomosis group (five patients); numbness of the tongue was the second most common complication (four patients). None of the patients developed dysphagia. Facial reanimation is an effective procedure for the surgical rehabilitation of static and dynamic facial nerve functions. Significant improvement in facial nerve function may occur more than three years after surgery. Despite morbidities such as synkinesia, the sural graft technique demonstrates greater improvements in facial nerve function than VII-XII anastomosis in the short and long term following surgery, but this conclusion requires confirmation by larger studies with a greater number of patients.",1,,0,2,9.0,9,2,1,0,10.3892/etm.2013.1120,Exp Ther Med. 2013 Jul;6(1):101-104. doi: 10.3892/etm.2013.1120.

We present our outcomes using a quantitative measurement system and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Between 2000 and 2012, 23 patients had their facial paralysis reanimated by masseteric-facial coaptation. All patients are presented with complete unilateral paralysis. Their background, the aetiology of the paralysis, and the surgical details were recorded. A retrospective study of movement analysis was made using an automatic optical system (Facial Clima). Commissural excursion and commissural contraction velocity were also recorded. The mean age at reanimation was 43(8) years. The aetiology of the facial paralysis included acoustic neurinoma, fracture of the skull base, schwannoma of the facial nerve, resection of a cholesteatoma, and varicella zoster infection. The mean time duration of facial paralysis was 16(5) months. Follow-up was more than 2 years in all patients except 1 in whom it was 12 months. The mean duration to recovery of tone (as reported by the patient) was 67(11) days. Postoperative commissural excursion was 8(4)mm for the reanimated side and 8(3)mm for the healthy side (p=0.4). Likewise, commissural contraction velocity was 38(10)mm/s for the reanimated side and 43(12)mm/s for the healthy side (p=0.23). Mean percentage of recovery was 92(5)mm for commissural excursion and 79(15)mm/s for commissural contraction velocity.

Methods: Retrospective case review of 9 patients whose facial muscles were electrophysiologically proven to be reinnervated contralaterally. Results: The duration from symptom onset spanned from 3 to 114 months. All subjects had moderate-to-severe facial palsy initially. Contralateral reinnervation was observed in both traumatic and idiopathic causes, also in both complete and incomplete palsies. Cross-innervation is more frequently reported in muscles near the midline; however, this is the first report demonstrating evidence of cross-innervation in muscles far from the midline--the frontalis, the orbicularis oculi, and the zygomaticus. Conclusion: Although contralateral reinnervation after facial nerve palsy is a common observation, it has not gained appropriate attention. Without recognition of this phenomenon, misinterpretation of the electromyography may mislead the proper timing of nerve repair or reanimation procedure. Therefore, routine examination of motor action potential by contralateral stimulation during electromyography, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe palsy, would provide accurate assessment of the injured nerves and would help in appropriate decision making for further treatment.",0,,0,0,0.0,0,7,2,0,10.1097/MAO.0000000000000220,Otol Neurotol. 2014 Feb;35(2):e73-6. doi: 10.1097/MAO.0000000000000220.,"Yi Y, Jeong WJ, Kim W, Kim K.",2014,24317213,CMAP response,9.0,,,,,,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

We present a case series of patients treated with gracilis muscle free flap with motor innervation by the masseteric nerve. We discuss the surgical technique and quantify the movement granted by the muscle, the improvement in quality of life and aesthetic results. Materials and methods: We report ten patients with unilateral facial paralysis who underwent free gracilis muscle flap, between the years 2010 and 2012 in two tertiary hospitals. Results: It is not reported any failure of the microsuture with survival of all flaps. The muscle movement was quantified by vectors at rest and contraction with an average of 1.7 cm that initiated around the fourth month after surgery. Patients also reported a significant improvement in symmetry at rest as well as oral and ocular competition.

88,24481538,Pub-med,Objective outcomes analysis following microvascular gracilis transfer for facial reanimation: a review of 10 years' experience,"IMPORTANCE Objective assessment of smile outcome after microvascular free gracilis transfer is challenging, and quantification of smile outcomes in the literature is inconsistent. OBJECTIVE To report objective excursion and symmetry outcomes from a series of free gracilis cases and investigate the predictive value of intraoperative measurements on final outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective medical chart review was undertaken of all patients who underwent microvascular free gracilis transfer for smile at our institution over the past 10 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcome measures included the following: smile excursion, angle of smile with respect to the vertical midline, and facial symmetry during repose and with smile. Measurements were obtained using an automated tool for assessment of facial landmarks (FACE-Gram). An exhaustive set of intraoperative parameters including degree of recoil of the gracilis muscle following harvest, the degree to which the muscle foreshortened during stimulation of the obturator nerve, final stretched length of the inset muscle, surgeon assessment of neurorrhaphy and pulse pressure, ischemia time, number of sutures used during neurorrhaphy, nerve used to innervate the flap, and surgeon assessment of oral commissure overcorrection were recorded and placed into a linear regression model to investigate correlations with smile. RESULTS From March 2003 to March 2013, 154 microvascular free gracilis transfers were performed for facial reanimation at our institution, 14 (9%) of which were deemed failures. Of the remaining 140 flaps, 127 fulfilled inclusion criteria and constituted the study cohort. Smile excursion, angle excursion, and symmetry of the oral commissure at repose and with smile all improved following gracilis free flap (P < .05). Associations between selected outcomes measures and intraoperative gracilis measurements were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Facial reanimation using free gracilis transfer results in quantifiable improvements in oral commissure excursion and facial symmetry both at rest and with smiling. Associations between contractility and internal recoil of the flap and final outcome were identified.

Objective: This paper aimed to address the ideal time for surgical intervention and the appropriate surgical approach for patients with facial paralysis resulting from temporal bone fractures. Methods: We retrospectively investigated 60 patients with facial paralysis due to temporal bone fractures who underwent facial nerve decompression via different operative approaches within 1 month after trauma, of which 48 were surgically treated by the middle cranial fossa approach (80%), 8 by a pure transmastoid approach (13.3%), and four by a combined transmastoid and middle cranial fossa approach (6.7%). The House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system was used to evaluate the recovery of facial nerve function. Results: The follow-up period for all the patients was 1 year.

90,24867744,Pub-med,Facial synkinesia before and after surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face,"Background+C633: Facial synkinesia is a common sequela of facial palsy, affecting 15 to 20 percent of patients. The rate of postoperative synkinesia after facial reanimation is not clearly established. The severity and type of synkinesia determine the degree of clinical relevance. Methods: One hundred sixty-seven patients with facial palsy were included in this retrospective cohort study. Three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements was performed preoperatively and 18 months after facial reanimation. The severity of synkinesia was rated subjectively on a four-degree severity scale. Objective three-dimensional analysis of synkinesia was performed on patients with 18-month follow-up times. Results: Preoperatively, 84.4 percent of patients were not affected by synkinesia, 9 percent presented with mild synkinesia, 4.2 percent presented with moderate synkinesia, and 2.4 percent presented with severe synkinesia. Postoperatively, 51 percent of all patients presented with facial synkinesia (41.8 percent mild, 17.3 percent moderate, and 1 percent severe synkinesia; some patients had more than one type). Patients treated with territorially differentiated gracilis muscle transplantation were most frequently affected (69.8 percent), followed by patients treated with gracilis muscle transplantation in combination with temporalis muscle transposition to the eye (51.8 percent). Oculo-oral synkinesia was the most frequent form of synkinesia. Conclusions: After surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face, half of the patients presented with synkinesia. The majority of patients developed mild or moderate forms of synkinesia; therefore, the clinical relevance of synkinesia has to be seen in the context of total facial function. Because of the high prevalence of synkinesia, it should be documented and addressed in patients undergoing facial reanimation.

91,24939829,Pub-med,Facial reanimation with masseteric to facial nerve transfer: a three-dimensional longitudinal quantitative evaluation,"Facial paralysis is a severe pathological condition, negatively affecting patients' quality of life. The altered tone and mobility of the mimetic musculature provoke both functional and morphological deficits. In the present study, we longitudinally measured facial movements in 14 patients (21-69 years) affected by unilateral facial paralysis not lasting longer than 23 months. The patients were analyzed before and after surgical masseteric to facial nerve neurorrhaphy. Examinations were performed at least 3 months after they had clinically started to regain facial mimicry. The displacement of selected facial landmarks was measured using an optoelectronic three-dimensional motion analyzer during: maximum smile without clenching (pre- and postsurgery), maximum smile by clenching on their posterior teeth (only postsurgery), and spontaneous smile (recorded during the vision of a funny video in both examinations). Before facial surgery, in all smiles facial landmarks moved more in the healthy than in the paretic side; after surgery, the differences decreased for both reduction of the healthy-side motion, and increment of the paretic-side motion (motion ratio before 52%, after 87%, p < 0.05, Students' t-test). The ratio between the paretic and healthy-side total motion (asymmetry) did not modify for maximum and spontaneous smiles, but significantly increased for the maximum smiles made with teeth clenching (asymmetry before 32%, after 11%, p < 0.001). Spontaneous smiles were recorded only in a subset of patients, but their execution was modified by surgery, with more symmetrical movements of the rehabilitated-side landmarks (asymmetry before 33%, after 10%), and reduced motion of the healthy-side ones (motion ratio before 51%, after 83%). In conclusion, the significant asymmetry in the magnitude of facial movements that characterized the analyzed patients before surgery reduced after surgery, at least in those facial areas interested by the masseteric to facial nerve reanimation.",0,,0,0,3.0,9,1,2,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2014.05.039,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2014 Oct;67(10):1378-86. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2014.05.039.

92,24943646,Pub-med,Facial reanimation utilizing combined orthodromic temporalis muscle flap and end-to-side cross-face nerve grafts,"Background: Individuals with facial paralysis of 6 months or more without evidence of clinical or electromyographic improvement have been successfully reanimated utilizing an orthodromic temporalis transfer in conjunction with end-to-side cross-face nerve grafts. The temporalis muscle insertion is released from the coronoid process of the mandible and sutured to a fascia lata graft that is secured distally to the commissure and paralyzed hemilip. The orthodromic transfer of the temporalis muscle overcomes the concave temporal deformity and zygomatic fullness produced by the turning down of the central third of the muscle (Gillies procedure) while yielding stronger muscle contraction and a more symmetric smile. The muscle flap is combined with cross-face sural nerve grafts utilizing end-to-side neurorrhaphies to import myelinated motor fibers to the paralyzed muscles of facial expression in the miDFace and perioral region. Cross-face nerve grafting provides the potential for true spontaneous facial motion. We feel that the synergy created by the combination of techniques can perhaps produce a more symmetrical and synchronized smile than either procedure in isolation. Methods: Nineteen patients underwent an orthodromic temporalis muscle flap in conjunction with cross-face (buccal-buccal with end-to-side neurorrhaphy) nerve grafts. To evaluate the symmetry of the smile, we measured the length of the two hemilips (normal and affected) using the CorelDRAW X3 software. Measurements were obtained in the pre- and postoperative period and compared for symmetry. Results: There was significant improvement in smile symmetry in 89.5 % of patients. Conclusion: Orthodromic temporalis muscle transfer in conjunction with cross face nerve grafts creates a synergistic effect frequently producing an aesthetic, symmetric smile.

Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: All patients who underwent nasolabial fold modification at our institution since July 2010 were included in our analysis. Patient demographics and characteristics of their facial paralysis were noted. Preoperative Facial Clinimetric Evaluation scores were compared with postoperative scores to quantify outcomes. Pre- and postoperative photos were then presented to an observer for ratings of overall miDFacial appearance. Results: Thirty-one patients were included in the review. Most of the patients were male. The average onset of paralysis was 50 years, and the average age at time of surgery was 61 years. The majority of patients had flaccid paralysis, with 10% of patients having synkinesis. Most patients presented with complaints of oral incompetence or drooling and generalized facial asymmetry. Facial Clinimetric Evaluation scores (P < .004) and overall miDFacial appearance (P < .05) improved significantly following surgery.

94,25434708,Pub-med,Bidirectional/double fascia grafting for simple and semi-dynamic reconstruction of lower lip deformity in facial paralysis,"Background: For the total aesthetic reconstruction of facial paralysis, treatment of lower lip deformity as ""a neglected target in facial reanimation"" is important. Although various dynamic reconstruction approaches have been reported for lower lip deformity, these have not been popularly performed due to aggressive surgical invasiveness, long recovery time for reinnervation, and unstable outcomes. To reconstruct the lower lip deformity more simply but semi-dynamically, we modified bidirectional/double fascia grafting methods that have been established as simple and minimally invasive treatments for pediatric congenital lower lip paralysis. Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, nine patients were treated using this procedure alone or with combinations of other procedures of facial reanimation such as one-stage free muscle transfer. For outcome assessment, patients were evaluated using a lower lip paralysis grading system, including the objective aesthetics and functional results of the lower lip at rest (score range, 0-1), during smiling (score range, 0-4), and during mouth opening (score range, 0-2). Results: The mean total scores improved from 1.43 (poor) preoperatively to 5.71 (excellent) postoperatively. In all evaluation items, the postoperative scores improved significantly compared to the preoperative scores (p<0.01) with no severe complications. Conclusions: The procedure is simply applied to various types of extensive facial paralysis, as well as congenital lower lip paralysis in combination with other static and dynamic reconstruction methods for facial paralysis, and it is suggested that this approach significantly and semi-dynamically improves the aesthetic function of the lower lip at rest, during smiling, and during mouth opening.",0,,2,1,9.0,9,8,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.044,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2015 Mar;68(3):321-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.044.

Treatment is based on dynamic procedures such as functional muscle flaps. The benefit of added axonal load has recently been reported. This study describes a two stage technique involving dual innervation of a gracilis muscle flap with initial cross-facial nerve graft (CFNG) followed by free muscle transfer co-apted to both the CFNG and a masseter nerve for facial reanimation. Methods: A total of nine patients from August 2008-July 2011 were operated on with the double innervated gracilis muscle flap. Pre- and postoperative electromyography was documented, and video analysis with the five-stage classification of reanimation outcomes was performed. Results: All patients recovered voluntary and spontaneous smile abilities, with an average of 70% motor unit recruitment. Based on the Terzis reanimation outcome classification, four patients had an excellent result, four good, and one moderate.

96,25626821,Pub-med,The degree of facial movement following microvascular muscle transfer in pediatric facial reanimation depends on donor motor nerve axonal density,"Background: Free functional muscle transfer to the face is a standard of facial animation. The contralateral facial nerve, via a cross-face nerve graft, provides spontaneous innervation for the transferred muscle, but is not universally available and has additional shortcomings. The motor nerve to the masseter provides an alternative innervation source. In this study, the authors compared donor nerve histomorphometry and clinical outcomes in a single patient population undergoing free muscle transfer to the face. Methods: Pediatric patients undergoing dynamic facial (re-)animation with intraoperative nerve biopsies and gracilis transfer to the face powered by either the contralateral facial nerve via a cross-face nerve graft or the motor nerve to the masseter were reviewed over a 7-year period. Myelinated nerve counts were assessed histomorphometrically, and functional outcomes were evaluated with the Scaled Measurement of Improvement in Lip Excursion software. Results: From 2004 to 2011, 91 facial (re-)animation procedures satisfied study inclusion criteria. Average myelinated fiber counts were 6757 per mm2 in the donor facial nerve branch, 1647 per mm in the downstream cross-face nerve graft at the second stage, and 5289 per mm in the masseteric nerve. Reconstructions with either innervation source resulted in improvements in oral commissure excursion and smile symmetry, with the greatest amounts of oral commissure excursion noted in the masseteric nerve group. Conclusions: Facial (re-)animation procedures with use of the cross-face nerve graft or masseteric nerve are effective and result in symmetric smiles. The masseteric nerve provides a more robust innervation source and results in greater commissure excursion.

97,25824195,Pub-med,Masseteric nerve transfer for short-term facial paralysis following skull base surgery,"Background: Nerve transfers have been widely used to reanimate paralyzed facial muscles after irreversible proximal injuries to the facial nerve. The author has developed a technique involving masseteric nerve transfer combined with cross-facial nerve grafting for treating skull base surgery-induced facial paralysis. This paper aims to demonstrate that this procedure is effective and causes negligible donor site morbidity. Methods: Seven patients who developed facial paralysis after the removal of skull base tumors were treated with masseteric nerve transfer combined with cross-facial nerve grafting with the aim of reanimating the miDFace. The mean period of preoperative paralysis was 6 months. The follow-up period ranged from 22 to 65 months (mean: 46 months). The patients were evaluated with physical examinations and video analysis. Results: Successful reanimation of the miDFace was achieved in all patients except one, whose muscle tone recovered. On average, facial motion developed 4 months after the nerve transfer. Only minimal coordinated eyelid movement was seen during biting. None of the patients experienced impaired masticatory function or visible wasting of the masseter muscle. All of the patients who recovered the ability to contract their paralyzed muscles were able to close their eyes tightly during biting; however, none of the patients have been able to achieve an effortless spontaneous smile.

98,25868011,Pub-med,Single-stage dynamic reanimation of the smile in irreversible facial paralysis by free functional muscle transfer,"Unilateral facial paralysis is a common disease that is associated with significant functional, aesthetic and psychological issues. Though idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) is the most common diagnosis, patients can also present with a history of physical trauma, infectious disease, tumor, or iatrogenic facial paralysis. Early repair within one year of injury can be achieved by direct nerve repair, cross-face nerve grafting or regional nerve transfer. It is due to muscle atrophy that in long lasting facial paralysis complex reconstructive methods have to be applied. Instead of one single procedure, different surgical approaches have to be considered to alleviate the various components of the paralysis. The reconstruction of a spontaneous dynamic smile with a symmetric resting tone is a crucial factor to overcome the functional deficits and the social handicap that are associated with facial paralysis. Although numerous surgical techniques have been described, a two-stage approach with an initial cross-facial nerve grafting followed by a free functional muscle transfer is most frequently applied. In selected patients however, a single-stage reconstruction using the motor nerve to the masseter as donor nerve is superior to a two-stage repair. The gracilis muscle is most commonly used for reconstruction, as it presents with a constant anatomy, a simple dissection and minimal donor site morbidity. Here we demonstrate the pre-operative work-up, the post-operative management, and precisely describe the surgical procedure of single-stage microsurgical reconstruction of the smile by free functional gracilis muscle transfer in a step by step protocol. We further illustrate common pitfalls and provide useful tips which should enable the reader to truly comprehend the procedure.

99,25878931,Pub-med,Postparalysis facial synkinesis: clinical classification and surgical strategies,"Background: Postparalysis facial synkinesis (PPFS) can occur after any cause of facial palsy. Current treatments are still inadequate. Surgical intervention, instead of Botox and rehabilitation only, for different degrees of PPFS was proposed. Methods: Seventy patients (43 females and 27 males) with PPFS were enrolled since 1986. They were divided into 4 patterns based on quality of smile and severity of synkinesis. Data collection for clinically various presentations was made: pattern I (n = 14) with good smile but synkinesis, pattern II (n = 17) with acceptable smile but dominant synkinesis, pattern III (n = 34) unacceptable smile and dominant synkinesis, and pattern IV (n = 5) poor smile and synkinesis. Surgical interventions were based on patterns of PPFS. Selective myectomy and some cosmetic procedures were performed for pattern I and II patients. Extensive myectomy and neurectomy of the involved muscles and nerves followed by functioning free-muscle transplantation for facial reanimation in 1- or 2-stage procedure were performed for pattern III and many pattern II patients. A classic 2-stage procedure for facial reanimation was performed for pattern IV patients. Results: Minor aesthetic procedures provided some help to pattern I patients but did not cure the problem. They all had short follow-up. Most patients in patterns II (14/17, 82%) and III (34/34, 100%) showed a significant improvement of eye and smile appearance and significant decrease in synkinetic movements following the aggressively major surgical intervention. Nearly, all of the patients treated by the authors did not need repeated botulinum toxin A injection nor require a profound rehabilitation program in the follow-up period.

Materials and methods: Twenty-two patients with facial nerve paralysis due to acoustic neuroma, trauma, cholesteatoma, and parotid carcinoma were included in this study. In the lower facial region, the temporal muscle was suspended to the lower lip. In the upper facial region, eyelid gold implantation was performed. The reanimation results of the upper and lower facial regions were graded as excellent, good, fair, and poor in consideration of the symmetry after rest and smile according to May classification in the third month after the surgery. Results: The study group comprised 15 men (68.2%) and 5 women (31.8 %) (mean age, 63.82 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 14.18 years; range, 8-78 years).

Poor results were not observed in any patient. Conclusion: Facial paralysis is a disease that causes serious functional and psychological problems in patients. Therefore, the choice of treatment method is dependent on the etiology, duration of paralysis, expectations of the patient, and experience of the surgeon. Being less invasive methods, obtaining immediate results, requiring single surgical stage, and having long-lasting results and dynamic muscle transfer and static suspension methods are preferred.",0,,0,3,10.0,9,2,1,0,10.1097/SCS.0000000000001571,J Craniofac Surg. 2015 May;26(3):831-5. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000001571.,"Kumral TL, Uyar Y, Berkiten G, Mutlu AT, Ata‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚à´ E, S‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•nnet‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚à´i G, Yildirim G.",2015,25915681,"Tools: May's classification ""eyelid gold"" implantation also performed Negative Outcomes: inflammation Positive Outcomes: symmetry, complete eye-closure",17.0,,,,,,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
101,26026222,Pub-med,Double-powered free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation: A longitudinal optoelectronic study,"The choice of the motor donor nerve is a crucial point in free flap transfer algorithms. In the case of unilateral facial paralysis, the contralateral healthy facial nerve can provide coordinated smile animation and spontaneous emotional expression, but with unpredictable axonal ingrowth into the recipient muscle. Otherwise, the masseteric nerve ipsilateral to the paralysis can provide a powerful neural input, without a spontaneous trigger of the smile. Harvesting a bulky muscular free flap may enhance the quantity of contraction but esthetic results are unpleasant. Therefore, the logical solution for obtaining high amplitude of smiling combined with spontaneity of movement is to couple the neural input: the contralateral facial nerve plus the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Thirteen patients with unilateral dense facial paralysis underwent a one-stage facial reanimation with a gracilis flap powered by a double donor neural input, provided by both the ipsilateral masseteric nerve (coaptation by an end-to-end neurorrhaphy with the obturator nerve) and the contralateral facial nerve (coaptation through a cross-face nerve graft: end-to-end neurorrhaphy on the healthy side and end-to-side neurorrhaphy on the obturator nerve, distal to the masseteric/obturator neurorrhaphy). Their facial movements were evaluated with an optoelectronic motion analyzer. Before surgery, on average, the paretic side exhibited a smaller total three-dimensional mobility than the healthy side, with a 52% activation ratio and >30% of asymmetry. After surgery, the differences significantly decreased (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p < 0.05), with an activation ratio between 75% (maximum smile) and 91% (maximum smile with teeth clenching), and <20% of asymmetry. Similar modifications were seen for the performance of spontaneous smiles. The significant presurgical asymmetry of labial movements reduced after surgery. The use of a double donor neural input permitted both movements that were similar in force to that of the healthy side, and spontaneous movements elicited by emotional triggering.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,0,3.0,2,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2015.03.029,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2015 Jul;68(7):930-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2015.03.029.

102,26061795,Embase,Reconstruction of facial nerve after radical parotidectomy,"Conclusion: Most patients benefitted from immediate facial nerve grafting after radical parotidectomy. Even weak movement is valuable and can be augmented with secondary static operations. Post-operative radiotherapy does not seem to affect the final outcome of facial function. Objectives: During radical parotidectomy, the sacrifice of the facial nerve results in severe disfigurement of the face. Data on the principles and outcome of facial nerve reconstruction and reanimation after radical parotidectomy are limited and no consensus exists on the best practice. Method: This study retrospectively reviewed all patients having undergone radical parotidectomy and immediate facial nerve reconstruction with a free, non-vascularized nerve graft at the Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland during the years 1990-2010. There were 31 patients (18 male; mean age = 54.7 years; range = 30-82) and 23 of them had a sufficient follow-up time. Results: Facial nerve function recovery was seen in 18 (78%) of the 23 patients with a minimum of 2-year follow-up and adequate reporting available. Only slight facial movement was observed in five (22%), moderate or good movement in nine (39%), and excellent movement in four (17%) patients. Twenty-two (74%) patients received post-operative radiotherapy and 16 (70%) of them had some recovery of facial nerve function.

103,26143295,Pub-med,Masseteric-facial nerve transposition for reanimation of the smile in incomplete facial paralysis,"Incomplete f+C636acial paralysis occurs in about a third of patients with Bell's palsy. Although their faces are symmetrical at rest, when they smile they have varying degrees of disfigurement. Currently, cross-face nerve grafting is one of the most useful techniques for reanimation. Transfer of the masseteric nerve, although widely used for complete paralysis, has not to our knowledge been reported for incomplete palsy. Between December 2008 and November 2013, we reanimated the faces of 9 patients (2 men and 7 women) with incomplete unilateral facial paralysis with transposition of the masseteric nerve. Sex, age at operation, cause of paralysis, duration of denervation, recipient nerves used, and duration of follow-up were recorded. Commissural excursion, velocity, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated with the FACIAL CLIMA and a questionnaire, respectively. The mean (SD) age at operation was 39 (¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±6) years and the duration of denervation was 29 (¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±19) months. There were no complications that required further intervention. Duration of follow-up ranged from 6-26 months. FACIAL CLIMA showed improvement in both commissural excursion and velocity of more than two thirds in 6 patients, more than one half in 2 patients and less than one half in one. Qualitative evaluation showed a slight or pronounced improvement in 7/9 patients. The masseteric nerve is a reliable alternative for reanimation of the smile in patients with incomplete facial paralysis.

105,26595022,Pub-med,Epidemiologic Overview of Synkinesis in 353 Patients with Longstanding Facial Paralysis under Treatment with Botulinum Toxin for 11 Years,"Background: Patients with longstanding facial paralysis often exhibit synkinesis. Few reports describe the prevalence and factors related to the development of synkinesis after facial paralysis. Botulinum toxin type A injection is an important adjunct treatment for facial paralysis-induced asymmetry and synkinesis. The authors assessed the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with sequelae of facial paralysis treated with botulinum toxin type A injections to evaluate the prevalence of synkinesis and related factors. Methods: A total of 353 patients (age, 4 to 84 years; 245 female patients) with longstanding facial paralysis underwent 2312 botulinum toxin type A injections during an 11-year follow-up. Doses used over the years, previous treatments (electrical stimulation, operations), and how they correlated to postparalysis and postreanimation synkinesis were analyzed. Results: There was a significant association between cause and surgery. Most patients with facial paralysis caused by a congenital defect, trauma, or a tumor underwent reanimation. There were no sex- or synkinesis-related differences in the doses used, but the doses were higher in the reanimation group than in the no-surgery group. Synkinesis was found in 196 patients; 148 (41.9 percent) presented with postparalysis synkinesis (oro-ocular, oculo-oral) and 58 (16.4 percent) presented with postreanimation synkinesis. Ten patients presented with both types. Conclusions: This study determined the high prevalence (55.5 percent) of synkinesis in patients with longstanding facial paralysis. Postparalysis synkinesis was positively associated with infectious and idiopathic causes, electrical stimulation, facial nerve decompression, and no requirement for surgery. Postreanimation synkinesis was present in 28.2 percent of reanimated patients and was significantly associated with microsurgical flaps, transfacial nerve grafting, masseteric-facial anastomosis, and temporalis muscle transfers.",4,,0,1,1.0,0,4,1,1,10.1097/PRS.0000000000001802,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2015 Dec;136(6):1289-1298. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000001802.,"Salles AG, da Costa EF, Ferreira MC, do Nascimento Remigio AF, Moraes LB, Gemperli R.",2015,26595022,,196.0,,,,,,,,"Other type of nerve graft: masseteric, cross facial",,Masseteric nerve transfer,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,
106,26710031,Pub-med,Intracranial Facial Nerve Grafting in the Setting of Skull Base Tumors: Global and Regional Facial Function Analysis and Possible Implications for Facial Reanimation Surgery,"Background: Reconstructive surgeons may encounter patients presenting after intracranial facial nerve resection and grafting in the setting of skull base tumors, who inquire regarding progression, final facial function, and need for future operations. Study goals were to analyze global and regional facial function using established grading systems and videography, while examine variables possibly affecting outcomes. Methods: Between 1997 and 2012, 28 patients underwent intracranial nerve grafting. Fifteen were prospectively evaluated by three facial nerve physical therapists with the Facial Nerve Grading System 2.0 and the Sunnybrook Facial Grading Score for function and the Facial Disability Index for quality of life. Still photographs and videography were used to assess quality of motion and tone, while demographic and medical variables were analyzed regarding their effect on end results. Results: Average patient age was 41.9 years (range, 22 to 66 years), and there were 10 women and five men. Average time interval between nerve grafting and evaluations was 42.9 months (range, 12 to 146 months). Both grading scores demonstrated best outcomes in the periorbita and worst outcomes in the brow. Buccinator muscle tone also improved. The average total Facial Disability Index was 67.5 percent. Although not statistically significant, the data suggest that nerve gap length affected total resting symmetry and voluntary movement, whereas preoperative palsy and age may affect total resting symmetry. Perioperative radiation therapy, tumor type, donor nerve, and coaptation technique were not found to affect outcomes. Conclusions: Intracranial facial nerve grafting largely provides better resting tone and facial symmetry, potentially improving end results of future intervention; however, overall voluntary facial motion is poor.

Methods: This study included 50 patients with complete facial paralysis immediately after acoustic neuroma surgery. Data were analyzed into 4 groups according to the need and type of reconstruction of the facial nerve, either none, immediate, or on a deferred basis. All patients had intraoperative facial nerve monitoring, and facial nerve function was evaluated according the House-Brackmann (HB) scale. Results: Of all patients with immediate total paralysis, no patients achieved totally normal facial function (grade I), and only 5 (10%) recovered to a grade II. For all groups included, the majority of patients (82%) achieved an acceptable final facial function (grade III HB). In this series, only 2 patients remained with a grade VI facial function. Conclusions: The possibility of recovering near normal facial function after a grade VI facial paralysis is very low. Procedures like the immediate repair of the facial nerve with an interposed donor graft may provide better facial function in patients with partially injured facial nerve.

108,26752232,Pub-med,Assessment of functional outcomes of temporalis muscle transfers for patients with longstanding facial paralysis,"Background: Usually, clinical evaluation of facial reanimation provides accurate information about contraction of the mimetic muscles and phonation but fails to identify smile recovery and to quantify the motility of the lower third of the face during a smile. The purpose of this study was to verify that, in longstanding facial palsy, the modified temporalis muscle transfer (MTMT) can result in the ability to smile, not only voluntarily with chewing, but also spontaneously with a sudden emotional stimulus, and to confirm that a symmetric smile can be obtained. Methods: Ten patients of the treated group (group T; 4 women and 6 men) were randomly selected from a population of 24 patients with longstanding facial palsy treated by MTMT. Five normal subjects of the control group (group C; 3 women and 2 men) were enrolled as the control population. Functional outcomes after transposed temporalis muscle were examined and measured through clinical assessment by using a scored smile symmetry grading system, video recording, and surface electromyography (sEMG). In addition, the voluntary smile test (VST) and the not-voluntary smile test (NVST) were performed to study voluntary and spontaneous smiling. Results: Subjects in the VST group (group T) were able to smile voluntarily and the expression was characterized by symmetry. In the NVST group, they were able to smile spontaneously and the symmetry of the smile was maintained for 8 subjects and only partially for 2 subjects. During both tests, the temporalis muscle of the treated side and the orbicularis oris muscle of the not-treated side were activated during smiling, indicating spontaneous activity of the transposed temporalis muscle with an emotional stimulus. For the control group, smiles during VST and NVST were symmetric and the temporalis muscles were not activated during smiling, whereas the orbicularis oris muscles were. Conclusion: Our study shows that the Morrison MTMT is able to restore the voluntary smile ability. Particularly, this technique allows for recovery of the spontaneous smile with symmetry. This assessment would seem to suggest that the transposed temporalis muscle might adapt from a chewing to a mimetic muscle. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

109,26761513,Pub-med,Lengthening Temporalis Myoplasty for Single-Stage Smile Reconstruction in Children with Facial Paralysis,"Background: Free muscle transfer for dynamic smile reanimation in facial paralysis is not always predictable with regard to cosmesis. Hospital stays range from 5 to 7 days. Prolonged operative times, longer hospital stays, and excessive cheek bulk are associated with free flap options. Lengthening temporalis myoplasty offers single-stage smile reanimation with theoretical advantages over free tissue transfer. Methods: From 2012 to 2014, 18 lengthening temporalis myoplasties were performed in 14 children for smile reconstruction. A retrospective chart review was completed for demographics, operative times, length of hospital stay, and perioperative complications. Results: Fourteen consecutive patients with complete facial paralysis were included. Four patients underwent single-stage bilateral reconstruction, and 10 underwent unilateral procedures.

Average length of stay was 3.3 days (4.75 days for bilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty and 2.8 for unilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty). Nine patients required minor revisions. Conclusions: Lengthening temporalis myoplasty is a safe alternative to free tissue transfer for dynamic smile reconstruction in children with facial paralysis. Limited donor-site morbidity, shorter operative times, and shorter hospital stays are some benefits over free flap options. However, revisions are required frequently secondary to tendon avulsions and adhesions.

Both the House-Brackmann (HB) scale and our own, newly-designed scale to rate facial reanimation post nerve transfer (quantifying symmetry at rest and when smiling, eye occlusion, and eye and mouth synkinesis when speaking) were used to enumerate the extent of recovery. Results: With both the HB and our own facial reanimation scale, the HFD and MF procedures yielded better outcome scores than HFG, though only the HGD was statistically superior. HGD produced slightly better scores than MF for everything but eye synkinesis, but these differences were generally not statistically significant. Delaying surgery beyond 2 years since injury was associated with appreciably worse outcomes when measured with our own but not the HB scale.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different facial nerve reconstruction techniques. Methods: Facial nerve reconstruction was performed in 22 patients (facial nerve interpositional graft in 11 patients and hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer in another 11 patients). All patients had facial function House-Brackmann (HB) grade VI, either caused by trauma or after resection of a tumor. All patients were submitted to a primary nerve reconstruction except 7 patients, where late reconstruction was performed two weeks to four months after the initial surgery. The follow-up period was at least two years. Results: For facial nerve interpositional graft technique, we achieved facial function HB grade III in eight patients and grade IV in three patients. Synkinesis was found in eight patients, and facial contracture with synkinesis was found in two patients. In regards to hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer using different modifications, we achieved facial function HB grade III in nine patients and grade IV in two patients. Facial contracture, synkinesis and tongue atrophy were found in three patients, and synkinesis was found in five patients. However, those who had primary direct facial-hypoglossal end-to-side anastomosis showed the best result without any neurological deficit.

113,27348018,Pub-med,Transposition of the Intratemporal Facial to Hypoglossal Nerve for Reanimation of the Paralyzed Face: The VII to XII TranspositionTechnique,"Importance: The hypoglossal nerve has long been an axonal source for reinnervation of the paralyzed face. In this study, we report our experience with transposition of the intratemporal facial nerve to the hypoglossal nerve for facial reanimation. Objectives: To determine the feasibility and outcomes of the transposition of the infratemeporal facial nerve for end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve for facial reanimation. Design, settings, and participants: A case series of 20 patients with facial paralysis who underwent mobilization and transposition of the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve for an end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve (the VII to XII technique). Participants were treated between January 2007 and December 2014 at a tertiary care center. Main outcomes and measures: Outcome measures include paralysis duration, facial tone, facial symmetry at rest, and with smile, oral commissure excursion, post-reanimation volitional smile, and synkinesis. Methods: Demographic data, the effects of this technique on facial tone, symmetry, oral commissure excursion and smile recovery were evaluated. Preoperative and postoperative photography and videography were reviewed. Facial symmetry was assessed with a facial asymmetry index. Smile outcomes were evaluated with a visual smile recovery scale, and lip excursion was assessed with the MEEI-SMILE system. Results: All 20 patients had adequate length of facial nerve mobilized for direct end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve. The median duration of facial paralysis prior to treatment was 11.4 months. Median follow-up time was 29 months. Three patients were excluded from functional analysis due to lack of follow-up. Facial symmetry at rest and during animation improved in 16 of 17 patients. The median (range) time for return of facial muscle tone was 7.3 (2.0-12.0) months. A significant reduction in facial asymmetry index occurred at rest and with movement. The MEEI FACE-gram software detected a significant increase in horizontal, vertical, overall lip excursion and smile angle. No patient developed significant tongue atrophy, impaired tongue mobility, or speech or swallow dysfunction. Conclusions and relevence: Mobilization of the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve provides adequate length for direct end-to-end coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve and is effective in restoring facial tone and symmetry after facial paralysis. The resulting smile is symmetric or nearly symmetric in the majority of patients with varying degree of dental show. The additional length provided by utilizing the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve reduces the deficits associated with complete hypoglossal division/splitting, and avoids the need for interposition grafts and multiple coaptation sites.

114,27353412,Pub-med,Facial nerve repair after operative injury: Impact of timing on hypoglossal-facial nerve graft outcomes,"Purpose: Reanimation of facial paralysis is a complex problem with multiple treatment options. One option is hypoglossal-facial nerve grafting, which can be performed in the immediate postoperative period after nerve transection, or in a delayed setting after skull base surgery when the nerve is anatomically intact but function is poor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of timing of hypoglossal-facial grafting on functional outcome. Materials and methods: A retrospective case series from a single tertiary otologic referral center was performed identifying 60 patients with facial nerve injury following cerebellopontine angle tumor extirpation. Patients underwent hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis following facial nerve injury. Facial nerve function was measured using the House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system at a median follow-up interval of 18months.

115,27460946,Pub-med,Spontaneity of smile after facial paralysis rehabilitation when using a non-facial donor nerve,"Introduction: The current focus in dynamic reanimation of facial paralysis lies not only in restoring movement but also regaining smile spontaneity. It has been argued that a spontaneous smile can only be achieved using the contralateral facial nerve as donor via cross-face nerve grafting. Techniques based on the motor nerve to the masseter, however, have shown good rates of spontaneity as well. Patients and methods: Patients with complete facial paralysis reanimated using free gracilis to masseteric nerve or masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer were included. Patients were grouped according to gender comparing the rates of spontaneous smile. Results: Thirty-six patients (17 women and 19 men) underwent gracilis innervated by the masseteric nerve whereas masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer was performed in 30 cases (14 women and 16 men). For both techniques, women showed significantly higher rates of spontaneity. Additionally, women recovered spontaneity earlier than men. Conclusions: Along with providing a strong and reliable commissural pull, the motor nerve to the masseter is able to restore spontaneity as well. Women seem more prone to achieving it. Brain plasticity and the close relationship between the cortical areas of the masseteric and facial nerves are most likely the mechanisms underlying smile spontaneity.",4,,1,0,0.0,2,8,1,0,10.1016/j.jcms.2016.06.031,J Craniomaxillofac Surg. 2016 Sep;44(9):1305-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jcms.2016.06.031.

116,27501201,Pub-med,Free anterolateral thigh flap and masseter nerve transfer for reconstruction of extensive periauricular defects: Surgical technique and clinical outcomes,"Background: Radical tumor ablation in the periauricular area often results in extensive soft tissue defects, including facial nerve sacrifice, bone and/or dura defects. Reconstruction of these defects should aim at restoring facial reanimation, wound closure, and facial and neck contours. We present our experience using free anterolateral thigh flap (ALT) in combination with masseter nerve to facial nerve transfer in managing complex defects in the periauricular area. Methods: Between 2011 and 2015 six patients underwent a combined procedure of ALT flap reconstruction and masseter nerve transfer, to reconstruct extensive, post tumor resection, periauricular defects. The ALT flap was customized according to the defect. For smile restoration, the masseter nerve was transferred to the buccal branch of the facial nerve. If the facial nerve stump was preserved, interposition of nerve grafts to the zygomatic and frontal branches was performed to provide separate eye closure. The outcomes were analyzed by assessing wound closure, contour deformity, symmetry of the face, and facial nerve function. Results: There were no partial or total flap losses. Stable wound closure and adequate volume replacement in the neck was achieved in all cases, as well as good facial tonus and symmetry. The mean follow-up time of clinical outcomes was 16.8 months. Smile restoration was graded as good or excellent in four cases, moderate in one and fair in one.

Objective: This study compared surgical techniques for hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after schwannoma removal and evaluated which technique achieves better facial outcomes and less tongue morbidity. Method: This study included 14 patients who underwent hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after schwannoma removal and were followed for more than 1 year. Three surgical techniques were performed: end-to-end, end-to-side, and split anastomoses. Facial palsy and tongue atrophy after anastomosis were evaluated using the scales suggested by House-Brackmann and Martins, respectively. Tumor volume and the time to surgery were also evaluated, and the effects on facial outcomes were analyzed. Results: Overall, nine of 14 (64.3%) patients had favorable facial outcomes, and eight of 14 (57.1%) had favorable tongue outcomes. Regarding facial palsy, five of seven (71.4%) end-to-end, three of four (75%) split, and only one of three (33.3%) end-to-side patients had favorable facial function. Regarding tongue atrophy, all three (100%) end-to-side, three of four (75%) split, and two of seven (28.6%) end-to-end patients had favorable tongue outcomes.

118,27988149,Pub-med,A technique for facial reanimation: The partial temporalis muscle-tendon transfer with a fascia lata sling,"Background: This report describes the results of a surgical procedure for facial reanimation. This single-stage technique involves the orthodromic transfer of only a superficial segment of the temporalis tendon. This is extended with fascia lata to achieve elevation of the oral commissure along the desired vector in the paralysed hemi-face. Methods: A retrospective case note review was performed. Patients' photographs were objectively evaluated with Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation (FACE) software. Results: Thirty-nine patients underwent the procedure from 2001 to 2011. Median age at the operation was 57.0 years (interquartile range (IQR) 38.2-66.3 years), and median duration of follow-up was 0.9 years (IQR 0.5-1.8 years). All patients achieved early improvements in appearance and function after surgery. Three patients underwent further, minor procedures for aesthetic and functional adjustments around the oral commissure. Complications occurred in three patients: two minor facial haematomas and one thigh wound infection. The surgery did not disturb natural temporalis muscle function. FACE analysis demonstrated that no significant movement of the oral commissure occurred during attempted smiling in the paralysed hemi-face before surgery. However, symmetry was achieved when the healthy and paralysed hemi-faces were compared post-operatively, both in repose and during controlled smiling. Conclusions: This modified, single-stage technique for facial reanimation improves commissure mobilisation and has been objectively shown to restore symmetry of the commissure to the reanimated hemi-face.",0,,0,1,9.0,1,1,2,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2016.10.011,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2017 Mar;70(3):313-321. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2016.10.011.

119,28002243,Pub-med,Smile Reanimation after Unilateral Facial Palsy by Lengthening Temporalis Myoplasty: Objective and Subjective Evaluation on 25 Cases,"Background: Comparison of functional results of lengthening temporalis myoplasty relies in current practice on subjective scales. The goal of this study was to define a simple, reproducible, objective scale validated through a comparison with a subjective scale for smile symmetrization results after temporal muscle myoplasty. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 25 patients having a unilateral facial palsy and rehabilitated with lengthening temporalis myoplasty. Evaluation consisted of objective measures: smile horizontal symmetry between left and right sides, vertical symmetry, and smile width on healthy and paretic sides on preoperative and postoperative photographs. Subjective scales were also used (i.e., a numeric scale and the Terzis and Noah scale) by a jury (four professionals and four nonprofessionals) and the patient himself or herself. Each evaluation was performed in three conditions: at rest, at intermediary smile, and at maximum smile. Results: Comparison of objective measures on the impaired side showed a postoperative improvement in the three conditions evaluation. Reproducibility of the numeric scale was weak for evaluation at rest and fair for maximum smile evaluation (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.57). The Terzis and Noah scale was not reproducible from one observer to another. At maximum smile, a correlation between smile symmetry in the vertical plane, smile symmetry in the horizontal plane, and professional evaluation with the numeric scale on the one hand and global patient satisfaction on the other hand was observed. Conclusion: Postoperative smile horizontal symmetry between left and right sides, and smile vertical symmetry, are good indicators with which to assess postoperative results of facial palsy rehabilitation.",0,,0,1,0.0,9,8,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0000000000003217,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2017 Apr;139(4):984e-993e. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000003217.,"Foirest C, Granger B, Gatignol P, Bernat I, Nguyen Y, Lamas G, Tankere F.",2017,28002243,,25.0,,,,,,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

The eFACE is one such tool. Objective: To determine test-retest reliability of the eFACE tool over time and agreement between eFACE assessments made in person vs those made using video of facial mimetic function. Design, setting, and participants: A prospective observational study was conducted among 75 consecutive patients with varying degrees of facial palsy who presented between July 1 and December 31, 2014, to an academic tertiary referral hospital. Facial symmetry of all patients was graded in person and via standardized photographic and video documentation of facial mimetic function at the initial visit.

121,28299269,Pub-med,Temporalis pull-through vs fascia lata augmentation in facial reanimation for facial paralysis,"Objectives: Surgical rehabilitation of facial palsy is challenging as each case is unique and success rate is often unpredictable. In one technique, temporalis is elevated from origin preserving vessels, and this elevation increases the length which is tunneled into buccal tissues (pull-through technique, Group A). In the other technique, a harvested fascia lata is attached to temporalis after a coronoidectomy release and the fascia lata is attached to the modiolus (Group B). The aim of this study is to compare the two different surgical techniques. Materials and methods: Case records of 22 cases, 15 females, and 7 males who were operated between 2008 and 2012 for facial palsy with at least 1-year follow-up, using either of the techniques were assessed for pull of muscle, postoperative pain, recovery time, motor control, and symmetry at rest. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results: The Group A (n = 7) and Group B (n = 15) formed the study group. In the Group A, residual asymmetry (n = 3), poor postoperative muscle pull (n = 2) were noticed while in the modified group it was 2 and 3, respectively. The technique used in Group B had better pull of muscle, symmetry, faster recovery time, and better motor control at 1-year follow-up than the conventional technique. Discussion and conclusion: The difference between the two groups is due to preservation of original muscular architecture, vascular channel supply. As the muscle is not traumatized, no fibrosis occurs aiding regaining of normal function. In addition, the facial reanimation is more successful in the Group B. The mechanism and success behind the technique used in Group B is discussed elaborately in terms of localregional anatomy and physiology.",0,,0,0,,0,2,3,0,10.4103/2231-0746.200323,Ann Maxillofac Surg. 2016 Jul-Dec;6(2):267-271. doi: 10.4103/2231-0746.200323.,Balaji SM.,2016,28299269,Visual analog scale (VAS),22.0,,,,,,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
122,28391532,Pub-med,Outcome of a graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation in patients with facial paralysis,"Peripheral paralysis of the facial nerve is the most frequent of all cranial nerve disorders. Despite advances in facial surgery, the functional and aesthetic reconstruction of a paralyzed face remains a challenge. Graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation is based on a modular principle. According to the patients' needs, precondition, and expectations, the following modules can be performed: temporalis muscle transposition and facelift, nasal valve suspension, endoscopic brow lift, and eyelid reconstruction. Applying a concept of a graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation may help minimize surgical trauma and reduce morbidity. Twenty patients underwent a graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation. A retrospective chart review was performed with a follow-up examination between 1 and 8 months after surgery. The FACEgram software was used to calculate pre- and postoperative eyelid closure, the level of brows, nasal, and philtral symmetry as well as oral commissure position at rest and oral commissure excursion with smile. As a patient-oriented outcome parameter, the Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire was applied. There was a statistically significant improvement in the postoperative score of eyelid closure, brow asymmetry, nasal asymmetry, philtral asymmetry as well as oral commissure symmetry at rest (p < 0.05). Smile evaluation revealed no significant change of oral commissure excursion. The mean Glasgow Benefit Inventory score indicated substantial improvement in patients' overall quality of life.

123,28617736,Pub-med,Symmetry Restoration at Rest after Masseter-to-Facial Nerve Transfer: Is It as Efficient as Smile Reanimation?,"Background: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a highly efficient technique for reanimating paralyzed muscle and has been reported to restore facial symmetry at rest. However, no systematic studies have been performed, and the effects of preoperative droop of the oral commissure on postoperative symmetry at rest have rarely been reported. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed 35 patients with masseteric-to-facial nerve anastomosis and assessed the quality and quantity of the dynamic recovery and the oral commissure symmetry at rest. The dynamic and static effects were then compared. Results: All of the patients' Terzis scores were increased postoperatively, and over half of the patients presented restored symmetric smiles (Terzis scores of 4 or 5). The postoperative symmetry scale of the oral commissure at rest improved in 18 of 35 patients. Both the mean postoperative altitude difference of oral commissure excursion and the postoperative altitude difference of bilateral oral commissure position were decreased compared with preoperative values. The preoperative symmetry had a significant effect on the postoperative altitude difference of the bilateral oral commissure position. The effects of the dynamic and static symmetry improvements were transformed to a comparable factor ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢‚àö‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√¢‚Ä†¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±.

Conclusions: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a reliable technique for smile reanimation. However, it has only a limited effect on the improvement of symmetry at rest.

Objective: To describe our experience with differential reanimation of the miDFace and lower face using separate motor sources in patients with short-term facial paralysis after brain surgery. Methods: Seven patients underwent combined nerve transfer (the masseteric nerve to the zygomatic branch and the hypoglossal nerve to the cervicofacial division of the facial nerve) and cross-facial nerve grafting with the aim of achieving a spontaneous smile. The median duration of paralysis before surgery was 7 mo and follow-up ranged from 7 to 31 mo (mean: 18 mo). For evaluation, both physical examination and video analysis were performed. Results: In all patients, reanimation of both the miDFace and the lower face was successful. A nearly symmetrical resting lip was achieved in all patients, and they were able to voluntarily elevate the corners of their mouths without visible synkinesis and to close their eyes while biting.

Significant postoperative improvements were demonstrated for ipsilateral commissure excursion with smile (preoperatively: -2.2 mm [SD 2.3 mm] vs postoperatively: 7.9 mm [SD 2.5 mm]; P = .002), with meaningful smile achieved in 11 of 12 cases (91.7%).

In this study we aimed to test a new method for assessing facial movements based on 3-dimensional analysis of the facial surfaces. Eleven patients aged between 42 and 77 years who had recently been affected by facial palsy (onset between 6 and 18 months) were treated by an operation based on triple innervation: the masseteric to temporofacial nerve branch, 30% of the hypoglossal fibres to the cervicofacial nerve branch, and the contralateral facial nerve through two cross-face sural nerve grafts. Each patient had five stereophotogrammetric scans: at rest, smiling on the healthy side (facial stimulus), biting (masseteric stimulus), moving the tongue (hypoglossal stimulus), and corner-of-the-mouth smile (Mona Lisa). Each scan was superimposed onto the facial model of the ""rest"" position, and the point-to-point root mean square (RMS) value was automatically calculated on both the paralysed and the healthy side, together with an index of asymmetry. One-way and two-way ANOVA tests, respectively, were applied to verify the significance of possible differences in the RMS and asymmetry index according to the type of stimulus (p=0.0329) and side (p<0.0001). RMS differed significantly according to side between the facial stimulus and the masseteric one on the paralysed side (p=0.0316). Facial stimulus evoked the most asymmetrical movement, whereas the masseteric produced the most symmetrical expression. The method can be used for assessing facial movements after facial reanimation.",4,,0,0,0.0,0,1,2,0,10.1016/j.bjoms.2017.11.015,Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2018 Jan;56(1):3-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bjoms.2017.11.015.

One of the worst conditions is the reduction or abolition of eye blinking. To prevent these adverse effects, surgical rehabilitation of eyelid function is the current treatment choice. In the present paper, we present a modification of the technique devised by Nassif to recover lids from long-standing paralysis. In our modification, the upper lid is rehabilitated by a platisma graft innervated by the contralateral facial nerve branches using a cross-face sural nerve graft. The lower lid is pulled upward by a fascia lata string suspension. Fourteen patients with unilateral facial paralysis were operated on consecutively. For each patient, two sets of frontal photographs with open and closed eyes were available, before and after the surgical rehabilitation. On average, eyelid lumen with closed eyes decreased by 2.6 mm (SD 2.4) after surgical rehabilitation (37% of the initial value). With open eyes, the decrement was 1.5 mm (SD 1.6, 15%). The modifications were highly significant (p < 0.01), with very large effect sizes.

Objective: To determine the feasibility of a multivector gracilis muscle flap design for reanimation after facial paralysis and to analyze the effect on the smile display zone. Design, setting, and participants: Prospective analysis of patients who underwent a double paddle multivector gracilis flap for complete facial paralysis between June 2015 and December 2016 was carried out in a tertiary hospital. Interventions: The gracilis muscle was harvested as a double paddle flap and inserted along 2 vectors for facial reanimation. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome measures were: (1) dental display (the number of maxillary teeth displayed on paralyzed vs normal sides), (2) exposed maxillary gingival scaffold width, (3) interlabial gap at midline and canine, (4) facial asymmetry index (FAI), and (5) dynamic periorbital wrinkling. Results: There were 10 women and 2 men between ages 20 and 64 years (mean [SD], 46 [15] years). Five flaps were reinnervated with facial and masseteric nerves, 5 with masseteric nerve only, and 2 with crossfacial nerve only. There was functional muscle recovery in all cases. On average there was additional 3.1 maxillary teeth exposed posttreatment when smiling (5.5 vs 8.6; CI, 7.9 to 16.6; P < .001). The mean exposed maxillary gingival scaffold width improved from 31.5 mm to 43.7 mm (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.3; P < .001). There was no significant difference in interlabial exposure at midline (7.1 mm vs 7.7 mm; CI, -1.5 to 2.7; P = .56) but a 56.4% improvement at the level of the canines (3.9 vs 6.1; CI, 0.1 to 4.3; P = .04). The mean FAI when smiling was reduced from 9.1 mm to 4.5 mm (CI, -8.0 to -1.2; P = .01). Dynamic wrinkling of the periorbital area with smiling was noted in 4 patients. Conclusions and relevance: The gracilis flap can be reliably designed as a functional double paddle muscle flap for a multivector facial reanimation. The multivector gracilis flap design is effective in improving all components of the smile display zone and has the potential for producing periorbital-wrinkling characteristic of a Duchenne smile.

130,29598895,Pub-med,Triple innervation for re-animation of recent facial paralysis,"Recent facial palsies are those in which fibrillations of the mimetic musculature remain detectable by electromyography (EMG). Such fibrillations generally cease 18-24 months after palsy onset. During this period, facial re-animation surgery seeks to supply new neural inputs to the facial nerve. Neural usable sources were divided into qualitative (contralateral facial nerve) and quantitative (hypoglossus and masseteric nerve), depending on the type of stimulus provided. To further improve the extent and quality of facial re-animation, we here describe a new surgical technique featuring triple neural inputs: the use of the masseteric nerve and 30% of the hypoglossus nerve fibres as quantitative sources was associated with the contralateral facial nerve (incorporated via two cross-face nerve grafts) as a qualitative source in order to restore facial movements in 24 consecutive patients. The use of two quantitative motor nerve sources together with a qualitative neural source appears to improve re-animation after facial paralysis, despite earlier doubts as to whether patients could use different nerves to produce facial movements. In fact, movement was much improved.

131,29625866,Pub-med,Mixed facial reanimation technique to treat paralysis in medium-term cases,"Recent facial paralyses, in which fibrillations of the mimetic muscles are still detectable by electromyography (EMG), allow facial reanimation based on giving new neural stimuli to musculature. However, if more time has elapsed, mimetic muscles can undergo irreversible atrophy, and providing a new neural stimulus is simply not effective. In these cases function is provided by transferring free flaps into the face or transposing masticatory muscles to reinstitute major movements, such as eyelid closure and smiling. In a small number of cases, patients affected by paralysis are referred late - more than 18 months after onset. In these cases, reinnervating the musculature carries a high risk of failure because some or all of the mimetic muscles may atrophy irreversibly while axonal ingrowth is taking place. A mixed reanimation technique to address this involves a neurorrhaphy between the masseteric nerve and a facial nerve branch for the orbicularis oculi, to ensure a stronger innervation to that muscle, associated with the transposition of the temporalis muscle to the nasiolabial sulcus. This gives good symmetry in the rest of the miDFace, while smiling movement is achievable, but not guaranteed. This one-time facial reanimation is particularly indicated for those who refuse major free-flap surgery or when that may be risky, as in previously operated and irradiated fields. More extensive procedures based on utilizing a free flap to recover smiling, while adding a cross-face nerve graft to restore blinking, may be proposed for motivated patients. Between 2010 and 2015, five patients affected by complete unilateral facial palsy underwent this technique in the Maxillofacial Surgery Department, San Paolo Hospital (Milan, Italy). Symmetry of the middle-third of the face at rest and recovery of smiling was quite good. Complete voluntary eyelid closure was obtained in all cases. Combining temporalis flap rotation and a masseteric-to-orbicularis-oculi-facial-nerve branch neurorrhaphy seems to be a valid solution for those medium-term referred patients.",2,,0,3,1.0,9,2,1,0,10.1016/j.jcms.2018.03.003,J Craniomaxillofac Surg. 2018 May;46(5):868-874. doi: 10.1016/j.jcms.2018.03.003.

132,29649064,Pub-med,Incomplete Facial Paralysis: The Use of the Ipsilateral Residual Facial Nerve as a Donor Nerve for Facial Reanimation,"Background: The reconstructive approach for incomplete facial paralysis is not yet determined. In this article, the authors present a new surgical approach for patients with incomplete facial paralysis in which residual, ineffective movement is detected preoperatively in the ipsilateral buccozygomatic territory of the paretic facial nerve. Methods: Sixteen patients with incomplete facial paralysis were found eligible for the procedure and underwent one-stage facial reanimation performed by the senior author (E.G.). Reanimation was performed using free gracilis muscle transfer with neural coaptation to an active facial nerve branch(es) responsible for the predetected buccozygomatic residual movement. Patients were reviewed in a systematic fashion using a combined still photographic and video scoring scale for symmetry at rest and at dynamic states. Results: Following surgery, improved symmetry was observed in the majority of observations of the mouth region at rest and while smiling and of the nasolabial fold region while smiling. There was no significant change in symmetry in the majority of observations of the eye region at rest and while smiling and the nasolabial fold region at rest. Video assessment of dynamic facial symmetry while smiling demonstrated improved symmetry in 91 percent of the observations (n = 191 observations). Comparison of mean scores for dynamic smile symmetry produced a statistically significant improvement of 1.68 points following surgery (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Based on this series, the authors recommend that use of the ipsilateral facial nerve buccozygomatic residual branch be considered as a donor nerve for facial reanimation using a free gracilis muscle transfer in patients with incomplete facial paralysis with residual preoperative movement in the miDFace.

Gracilis was the first choice of muscle. Three motor neurotizers: cross-face nerve graft (CFNG), spinal accessory nerve (XI) and masseter nerve (V3) have been used as neurotizers for different indications. Methods: A total of 362 cases of facial reanimation with FFMT were performed between 1986 and 2015. Of these, 350 patients with 361 FFMT were enrolled: 272 (78%) patients were treated by CFNG-gracilis, 56 (15%) by XI-gracilis, and 22 (6%) by V3-gracilis. Smile excursion score, cortical adaptation stage with tickle test for spontaneous smile, facial synkinesis, satisfaction score by questionnaire, and functional facial grading were used for outcome assessment. Results: The CFNG-gracilis in a 2-stage procedure achieved most natural and spontaneous smile when longer observation (‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´¬¨¬®¬¨¬¢2 years) was followed.

134,29787803,Pub-med,Quality of life and functional assessment of facial palsy patients: A questionnaire study,"Background: Facial palsy leads to functional and aesthetic deficits, which impair the quality of life of affected patients. General health-related and disease-specific questionnaires are available for quality of life assessment. In this study, observer-based analysis of facial function (Sunnybrook Facial Grading Scale) was compared patient-based to facial palsy-specific gradings (Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale and Facial Disability Index), and general health-related quality of life questionnaires (SF-36). We hypothesized that only facial palsy-specific instruments capture functional and social impairments of affected patients. Methods: Thirty facial palsy patients treated at a tertiary referral centre were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were unilateral facial palsy with stable facial function, age over 18 years and fluency in German. Facial function was assessed with general and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures and subsequently evaluated by the treating facial plastic surgeon. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics for all assessed measurements. Correlations were calculated to compare general and facial palsy-specific instruments, as well as observer-based grading. Results: Observer-based evaluation of facial function correlated well to the patients-based assessment of physical function, however social subscores did not correlate demonstrating the limited correlation of patient distress and facial nerve impairment. Physical function scores of disease-specific instruments did not correlate with general health assessment scores, while social function scores showed moderate to good correlations. Conclusion: Validated disease-specific instruments are essential for the assessment of facial palsy patients.

We present our experience utilizing the anterolateral thigh (ALT) free flap, orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer (OTTT), and facial nerve cable grafting to reestablish form and function. Material and methods: From 2010 to 2016, 17 patients underwent radical parotidectomy followed by immediate reconstruction. An ALT was harvested to accommodate the volume and skin defect. Additional fascia lata and motor nerve to vastus lateralis (MNVL) were obtained. Anastomosis of the ALT to recipient vessels was performed, most commonly using the facial artery and internal jugular vein. OTTT was performed by securing the medial tendon of the temporalis to orbicularis oris through a nasolabial incision. Fascia lata was tunneled through the lower lip, then secured laterally to the temporalis tendon. The MNVL was cable grafted from either the proximal facial nerve or masseteric nerve to the distal facial nerve branches. ALT fascia was suspended to the superficial muscular aponeurotic system. Results: Average follow up was 19 months. Only one patient failed to achieve symmetry attributed to dehiscence of OTTT. All patients achieved oral competence and dynamic smile with OTTT activation. Facial nerve recovery was seen in 8 patients. 5 reached a House Brackman Score of 3. Two donor site seromas and two wound infections occurred.

136,29944527,Pub-med,Surgical Refinement Following Free Gracilis Transfer for Smile Reanimation,"Importance: Gracilis free muscle transfer is widely regarded as the gold standard functional smile reanimation in long-standing facial palsy. Although most patients achieve meaningful oral commissure movement, a subset has suboptimal aesthetic outcomes due to miDFacial bulk or oral commissure malposition. Safe refinements that do not compromise excursion would be a welcome addition to the surgical armamentarium for this population. Objectives: The goal of this study was to describe surgical approaches to the 3 most common postoperative sequelae that detract from the final result after gracilis facial reanimation and to examine how these surgical refinements affect aesthetic outcome, smile excursion, and quality of life. Design: This was a retrospective case series. Setting: Tertiary care center (Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Facial Nerve Center). Participants: Of 260 gracilis transfers performed since 2003, meaningful excursion (>3 mm) but poor aesthetic outcome requiring additional surgery was noted in 21 patients and was related either to excess muscle bulk (9), resting inferior malposition of the oral commissure (9), or resting superior/lateral malposition of the oral commissure (3). Intervention: Specific surgical interventions to address each of these negative sequelae were developed and refined, to preserve muscle functionality but eliminate the unsightly feature. Main outcome: Aesthetic status, determined by miDFacial symmetry; quantitative smile excursion; and quality of life (using the FaCE instrument) were measured before and after revision. Results: Patients who underwent gracilis refinement directed at either muscle debulking, or gracilis tightening or loosening experienced significantly improved aesthetics/miDFacial symmetry and improved quality of life with no significant decrease in smile excursion.

The current literature is insufficient, with a small number of cases. The use of nerve transfers has gained recent popularity for reanimating facial palsy. The authors present a comparative study between cross-face nerve grafting and masseteric-to-facial nerve transposition for incomplete facial paralysis. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with incomplete unilateral facial paralysis were reanimated with either cross-face nerve grafting (group I, n = 10) or masseteric nerve transfer (group II, n = 18). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the FACIAL CLIMA dystem. Spontaneity of the movement and satisfaction were also assessed. Results: When comparing the reconstructed and the healthy sides, statistical differences were found in group I but not in group II, suggesting that the resulting movement was symmetrical in group II but not in group I. Intergroup comparison showed that both commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were higher in group II. Spontaneity in group I was higher than in group II, but patients in group II showed more satisfaction, both without being statistically significant. Conclusions: Reanimation of incomplete facial paralysis can be satisfactorily achieved with both cross-face nerve grafting and direct masseteric-to-facial nerve transposition. However, with the masseteric nerve, better symmetry, a higher degree of recovery, and an increased level of satisfaction are achieved in a one-stage operation.

Study design: A retrospective analysis of 40 pediatric patients who underwent FGMT for facial palsy at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Facial Nerve Center was performed. Preoperative and postoperative photography and videography were used to quantify smile excursion and facial symmetry. Preoperative and postoperative quality of life was assessed with the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) survey, a validated, patient-based instrument for evaluating facial impairment and disability. Results: Of the 40 patients who underwent FGMT for facial palsy, 38 patients had complete data including preoperative and postoperative photography and videography from 3 months to 10 years following surgery; 13 cases had >5 years of follow-up. FGMT resulted in significant improvements in smile excursion within several months, with continued improvements in smile excursion and symmetry demonstrated more than 5 years later. Fifteen patients completed preoperative and postoperative FaCE surveys, which demonstrated significant improvement in quality of life scores following FGMT.

139,30113447,Pub-med,Simultaneous Reconstruction of the Lower Lip with Gracilis Functioning Free Muscle Transplantation for Facial Reanimation: Comparison of Different Techniques,"Background: Functioning free muscle transplantation is currently the gold standard for the reconstruction of facial paralysis, focusing more on the upper lip reconstruction rather than on the lower lip. This study aimed to compare different lower lip reconstructive methods when performing functioning free muscle transplantation for facial reanimation. Methods: A retrospective review of functioning free muscle transplantation for facial reanimation from 2007 to 2015 was performed. Patients were divided into three groups: in group 1 (n = 15), a free plantaris tendon graft anchored to the gracilis muscle was passed into the lower lip to create a loop within; in group 2 (n = 12), an aponeurosis tail of the gracilis muscle was attached to the lower lip; and in group 3 (n = 18), no suspension of the lower lip was performed. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up. Outcomes were assessed by photographs and videos, including subjective evaluation of midline deviation and horizontal tilt and objective analysis of smile dimensions and area. Results: A total of 45 patients were included. Results from the subjective evaluation demonstrate group 1 patients having the best improvement (overall score: p = 0.004 and p = 0.005, Fisher's exact test). The objective evaluation showed group 1 and 2 patients with better results compared with group 3 (horizontal component, p = 0.009; vertical component, p = 0.004; area distribution, p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Conclusions: Both plantaris tendon graft and gracilis aponeurosis achieved better improvement in subjective and objective evaluations than those who had no reconstruction of the lower lip. In particular, the plantaris tendon graft can achieve the most lower lip excursion with overall improved symmetry.

140,30325893,Pub-med,Evaluation of Donor Morbidity following Single-Stage Latissimus Dorsi Neuromuscular Transfer for Facial Reanimation,"Background: Single-stage latissimus dorsi neuromuscular transfer has been a valuable option for dynamic smile reanimation. However, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the potential donor morbidity in such cases. The present study aimed to comprehensively analyze the donor morbidity following functional latissimus dorsi muscle transfer. Methods: Patients who underwent single-stage functional latissimus dorsi muscle transfer for smile reanimation between 2002 and 2016 were reviewed. Postoperative complications and functional impairments at the donor sites were evaluated. The Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire was used for assessing postoperative donor-site function. Results: Sixty patients, including 12 pediatric (18 years or younger) patients, were analyzed. Mean length of a harvested thoracodorsal nerve was 14.9 cm. Fourteen patients were treated with a dual innervation technique, in which both a descending and a transverse branch of the thoracodorsal nerve were harvested. Donor complications were observed in seven cases; all of them were seromas and resolved by simple aspiration. No other complications including scoliosis and sensory and/or motor disturbances in the upper extremities were encountered. Fifty patients responded to the Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire at a median follow-up of 51 months. The average score was 2.64, and all but three patients scored less than 10. No variables, including patient age (pediatric versus adult) and the use of a dual-innervation technique, affected the donor morbidities, including the functional deficits. Conclusion: Single-stage latissimus dorsi neuromuscular transfer for facial reanimation might be associated with a low rate of complications and minimal functional morbidity at the donor site.

141,30325983,Pub-med,Comparison of Objective Outcomes in Dynamic Lower Facial Reanimation With Temporalis Tendon and Gracilis Free Muscle Transfer,"Importance: Facial paralysis affects patients' physical, social, and psychological function. Dynamic smile reanimation can mitigate these effects, but there are limited data to guide the surgeon in selecting the best reanimation procedure for each patient. Objective: To compare quantitative changes in oral commissure symmetry and smile excursion following temporalis tendon transfer (T3) and gracilis free muscle transfer. Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective case series of 28 adults with unilateral facial paralysis seeking dynamic lower facial reanimation at a tertiary academic medical center between July 1, 2010, and July 30, 2014. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016. Interventions: Minimally invasive T3 (n = 14) compared with gracilis free muscle transfer (n = 14). Main outcomes and measures: Measured symmetry of the oral commissure between the healthy and paralyzed sides in the horizontal, vertical, and angular dimension and excursion of the paralyzed commissure following reanimation compared with the healthy commissure. Results: Of the 28 patients, 19 (68%) were women; mean (SD) age was 51.7 (17) years. Commissure symmetry during smile improved significantly for the T3 patients in the vertical and angular dimensions, and the gracilis free muscle transfer patients had significant improvement in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Commissure excursion significantly improved in both groups following surgery, with a larger improvement seen in the gracilis free muscle transfer group (11.3 mm; 95% CI, 7.0 to 15.5 mm) compared with the T3 group (4.8 mm; 95% CI, 0.2 to 9.3 mm), with a mean difference of 6.5 mm (95% CI, 0.7 to 12.4 mm; Cohen d, 0.86). Postoperative smile excursion of the paralyzed side was within 1.0 mm of the healthy side in the gracilis free muscle transfer group (95% CI, -2.1 to 4.0 mm). Conclusions and relevance: Temporalis tendon transfer and gracilis free muscle transfer both improve oral commissure symmetry and excursion in facial paralysis. The improvement in smile excursion appears to be larger in patients treated with gracilis free muscle transfer and, on average, the excursion approximates the contralateral healthy side.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,3,3.0,9,1,2,0,10.1001/jamaoto.2018.1964,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2018 Dec 1;144(12):1162-1168. doi: 10.1001/jamaoto.2018.1964.,"Oyer SL, Nellis J, Ishii LE, Boahene KD, Byrne PJ.",2018,30325983,"Tools: photos, FACEgram, Outcomes: Facial commissure symmetry, smile excursion",28.0,,,,,,,,,,Double innervation,,,,,,

An alternative to muscle free flaps is local muscle transposition, with the temporalis muscle transposition being the preferred procedure, because of its direction of pull when transposed. The present study aimed to compare outcomes of gracilis FFMT neurotised by the masseteric nerve and temporalis muscle transposition in longstanding facial palsy using patient-reported and aesthetic outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional comparison of gracilis FFMT and temporalis muscle transpositions was performed. Pre- and postoperative excursion measures were obtained. Patients were asked to answer a satisfaction questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire (FaCE scale) and a depression and anxiety questionnaire (HADS). Laypeople were asked to rate the pre- and postoperative aesthetic appearance. Results: Of 28 eligible patients, 10 gracilis and 12 temporalis patients participated. No significant differences were found between both groups in postoperative quality of life or depression/anxiety. Layperson observers judged the aesthetic appearance to be similar. Conclusion: In the present study, gracilis FFMT did not lead to superior quality of life and aesthetic outcomes compared to temporalis muscle transpositions.

143,30509736,Embase,Pre-operative masseter muscle EMG activation during smile predicts synchronicity of smile development in facial palsy patients undergoing reanimation with the masseter nerve: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Synchronicity of the oral commissure movement of a bilateral smile is a significant goal for reconstruction in facial reanimation and may only be guaranteed with use of the facial nerve as a donor nerve. Yet over the years several studies report some degree of spontaneity in certain patients when using a non-facial donor nerve, which indicates that synchronous initiation of the smile might be achievable with other donor nerves. We designed a prospective cohort study to evaluate whether pre-operative involuntary activation of the masseteric nerve during smile predicts development of a synchronous smile development when using the masseteric nerve for reanimation. Methods: In a prospective cohort study unilateral long-standing facial palsy patients scheduled for dynamic smile reanimation with a free functional muscle transplant using the masseteric nerve as a donor nerve were preoperatively evaluated via EMG for involuntary activation of the masseter muscle upon smiling, which we called coactivation. Postoperatively, six months after noting the first muscle contraction smile synchronicity was evaluated. We analyzed the synchronicity of the bilateral smile development by analyzing slow-motion video sequences of the patients that were taken while the patients were watching funny video sequences. Results were then correlated with the pre-operative EMG. Results: 30 patients were recruited for this prospective study and underwent facial reanimation surgery with a free gracilis transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve. 19 patients demonstrated involuntary coactivation of the masseter muscle upon smiling and 11 did not. Postoperatively all patients could demonstrate a voluntary smile. 94% of patients who had preoperative coactivation showed a synchronous movement of the oral commissure when smiling. In those patients, that did not show activation of the masseter muscle upon smiling 0% showed synchronicity. The preoperative coactivation of the masseter muscle is able to predict the outcome regarding synchronicity of the smile with a sensitivity of 99.7%, a specificity of 88.5% and 92.5% positive predictive value and 99.6% negative predictive value (p < 0.001 for all).

The aim of this study was to report long-term outcomes of neurorrhaphy for facial reanimation with interpositional graft. The roles of some variable factors in the outcome of neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft were also evaluated and compared.

We describe the trifurcation technique as a modification of the combined approach on example of two patients with locally advanced parotid cancer. Methods: Due to perineural invasion, extensive resection of the FN from the mastoid segment to the peripheral branches was required. For reanimation of the upper face, a complex cervical plexus graft was sutured end-to-end to the mastoid segment of the FN trunk. The branches of the graft enabled reanimation of three peripheral temporal and zygomatic branches. The mandibular branch was sutured end-to-side to the hypoglossal nerve (hypoglossal‚Äö√Ñ√¨facial nerve transfer, HFNT). Additionally, the buccal branch was independently reanimated with ansa cervicalis. Results: Facial reanimation was successful in both patients. Good resting tone and voluntary movement were achieved with a mild degree of synkinesis after 13¬¨‚Ä†months. Patient 1 showed the Sunnybrook (SB) composite score 69 [76 (voluntary movement score) ‚Äö√†√≠ 0 (resting symmetry score) ‚Äö√†√≠ 7 (synkinesis score)]. In patient 2, the SB composite score was 76 (80 ‚Äö√†√≠ 0 ‚Äö√†√≠ 4, respectively). Conclusions: In this trifurcation approach, cervical cutaneous plexus provides a long complex nerve graft, which allows bridging the gap between proximal FN stump and several peripheral branches without great expenditure.

146,31083101,Pub-med,Facial Nerve Translocation for Low Tension Neurorrhaphy to Masseteric Nerve,"Introduction: The techniques of facial reanimation are continually evolving in search of the ideal method for rehabilitating the paralyzed face. In the past, alternative cranial nerve motor nuclei have been used to power facial musculature. The trigeminal nerve is gaining popularity as a promising nerve to drive facial motion, particularly in the lower face. Objectives: This article describes a low-tension technique of using the transposed facial nerve to the trigeminal nerve (masseteric branch) for facial reanimation. Methods: Six patients over 2.5 years were treated with facial nerve translocation with division at the geniculate and direct neurorrhaphy to the motor branch of the masseter. Patients were evaluated by physical examination, measurement of oral commissure excursion using MEEI FACE-gram software, video assessment, Sunnybrook Facial Grading System, Facial Disability Index, and Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale (FaCE). Results: Patients demonstrated early motion within 4 months postoperatively and were placed into facial physical therapy. All demonstrated improvements in oral competence, strong oral commissure excursion with good symmetry, speech improvements, and variable results in facial tone. Synkinesis to the smile antagonists in the lower face was noted and treated with chemodenervation in three of six. No upper division synkinesis was noted. Conclusion: The motor branch of the trigeminal nerve is an effective option for facial reanimation via facial nerve translocation and end-to-end neurorrhaphy. Variable results in facial tone were noted with excellent oral commissure excursion. This procedure is safe in the reoperated mastoid.",4,,0,1,1.0,9,9,3,0,10.1097/MAO.0000000000002195,Otol Neurotol. 2019 Jun;40(5):e562-e565. doi: 10.1097/MAO.0000000000002195.,"Hetzler L, MacDowell S, Trahan J, Arriaga M, McDaniel LS.",2019,31083101,"MEEI FACEgram softwae, Sunnybrook Facial Gradig System, Facial Diability Index, FaCE Scale",6.0,,,,,,,,,,Motor nerve,Trigeminal nerve transfer,,,,,
147,31348359,Pub-med,"Using the ""Sugarcane Chewing"" Concept as the Directionality of Motor Neurotizer Selection for Facial Paralysis Reconstruction: Chang Gung Experiences","Background: Facial paralysis and postparalysis facial synkinesis both cause severe functional and aesthetic deficits. Functioning free muscle transplantation is the authors' preferred method for reconstructing both deformities. Methods: From 1985 to 2017, a total of 392 patients underwent 403 gracilis functioning free muscle transplantations for facial reanimation. Different motor neurotizers were used: cross-face nerve graft (74 percent), spinal accessory nerve (17 percent), and masseter nerve (8 percent). Smile excursion score, cortical adaptation stage, patient questionnaire, Hadlock lip excursion, and the Terzis evaluation systems were used to assess outcomes. Results: For smile excursion score, the spinal accessory and masseter nerve groups showed higher scores than the cross-face nerve graft group in the first 2 years, but no difference by 3-year follow-up. For cortical adaptation stage, nearly all cross-face nerve graft patients achieved stage IV or V spontaneity, the spinal accessory nerve group achieved at least stage III (independent) movement, but individuals in the masseter nerve group achieved only stage III or less. The cross-face nerve graft group also achieved higher scores according to the Hadlock system and the Terzis evaluation system compared with the other two groups. Conclusions: The concept of ""sugarcane chewing"" where the sweetness is the least at the tail but the most at the head can be simply applied for surgeons and patients in weighing the benefits and drawbacks during the motor neurotizer selection. Cross-face nerve graft-innervated gracilis is analogous to chewing sugarcane from tail to head; despite lower outcome measures earlier, it yields the highest scores at 3 years postoperatively. Masseter-innervated gracilis is akin to chewing sugarcane from head to tail, with greater outcome scores initially but little improvement at longer follow-up. Spinal accessory-innervated gracilis results fall in between these two groups.

These were recorded by stereophotogrammetry. Sixty healthy subjects were also recorded. The 3D reconstruction of each facial expression was registered onto the rest position scan, and the root mean square (RMS) point-to-point distance between the two 3D surfaces was calculated automatically for the facial thirds. RMS values on the rehabilitated hemiface were 74.8% (upper third), 46.6% (middle third), and 54.1% (lower third) of those recorded in healthy subjects. RMS values were higher in the middle and lower thirds than in the upper third, and during smile provided by masseteric stimulus (P<0.05). The rehabilitated hemiface differed more from healthy subject values than the healthy hemiface did (P<0.05). On average, patients were more asymmetric than healthy subjects (P=0.004).

The use of time-stamped video assessment revealed that spontaneous synchronous oral commissure movement in a median percentage of smiles was 33% in patients with dually innervated gracilis (interquartile range [IQR], 0%-71%), 20% of smiles in patients with nerve-to-masseter-driven gracilis (IQR, 0%-50%), and 75% of smiles in patients with cross-face nerve graft-driven gracilis (IQR, 0%-100%). Clinicians graded smile spontaneity in dually innervated cases as absent in 40% (n = 6 of 15), trace in 33% (n = 5 of 15) and present in 27% (n = 4 of 15). No association was demonstrated between clinician-reported spontaneity and objectively measured synchronicity. Conclusions and relevance: Dually innervated gracilis free muscle transfers may improve smile spontaneity compared with masseteric nerve-driven transfers but not to the level of cross-face nerve graft-driven gracilis transfers. Quantifying spontaneity is notoriously difficult, and most authors rely on clinical assessment. Our results suggest that clinicians may rate presence of spontaneity higher than objective measures, highlighting the importance of standardized assessment techniques.

151,31688275,Pub-med,Comparative Study of 2 Different Innervation Techniques in Facial Reanimation: Cross-face Nerve Graft-Innervated Versus Double-Innervated Free Gracilis Muscle Transfer,"Recently, 1-stage double innervation with the masseter nerve and the CFNG has gained popularity owing to its outcomes of powerful and synchronous muscle contraction. In this study, we compared CFNG- and double-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT) for facial palsy reconstruction.A total of 49 patients with facial palsy who underwent facial reanimation surgery from August 2013 to January 2017 were enrolled. The CFNG group (18 patients) underwent 2-stage CFNG innervation, whereas the double-innervated FGMT group (31 patients) underwent dual coaptation with end-to-end masseter nerve and end-to-side CFNG. The FACEgram software was used for evaluating smile excursion, symmetry index, spontaneous smile occurrence, Terzis' score including palsy pathogenesis, and clinical progress.In the CFNG group, the smile excursion at rest increased (P = 0.000); however, there was increased smile excursion both at rest and during smiling in the double-innervated FMGT group (rest P = 0.002, smile P = 0.028). Improvement of the symmetry index was observed only in the FMGT group (rest P = 0.001, smile P = 0.000). There was no significant difference in Terzis' scores. The average time to the first visible muscle contracture was statistically significantly shorter in the double-innervated FGMT group (P = 0.035). With respect to spontaneous smile achievement, the double-innervated FGMT group (25.8%) showed a satisfactory outcome.Cross-face nerve graft-innervated FGMT improved only smile excursion at rest, whereas double-innervated FGMT provided improvement in both the resting and smiling postures. Furthermore, the double-innervated FGMT group showed a higher symmetry index. However, the 2 operations did not show a significant difference in functional aspects.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,3,0.0,9,1,2,0,10.1097/SAP.0000000000002034,Ann Plast Surg. 2020 Feb;84(2):188-195. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000002034.,"Kim MJ, Kim HB, Jeong WS, Choi JW, Kim YK, Oh TS.",2020,31688275,"CFNG and double-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT); sural nerve harvested the lower leg, harvested gracilis muscle flap",18.0,7.0,,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:cross-face,masseter nerve","CFNG and double-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT); sural nerve harvested the lower leg, harvested gracilis muscle flap",Double innervation,,,,,,

A large number of surgical techniques have therefore been developed for FN repair. Our objective was to propose a surgical FN reanimation protocol for patients with irreversible anatomic or functional postsurgical injury of the FN in the cerebellopontine angle after vestibular schwannoma resection. Methods: The clinical study included a total of 16 patients undergoing side-to-end hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy (SEHFN) since 2010, in which the FN injury was always secondary to vestibular schwannoma surgery in the cerebellopontine angle using a retrosigmoid approach. All patients had complete clinical facial paralysis at the time of the SEHFN. The anatomic study was conducted using 3 heads and necks (6 SEHFN). Results: Twelve months after surgery, FN function assessment with the House and Brackmann scale showed 2 patients with grade II, 13 patients with grade III, and only 1 patient with grade IV, and after 2 years, 4 patients had grade II, 11 patients had grade III, and 1 patient had grade IV. The average length of the anastomotic translocation portion of the FN in the anatomic study was 34.76 mm.

153,31987714,Pub-med,A nasolabial fold reset technique for enhancing miDFace lifts in facial reanimation: Three-dimensional volumetric analysis,"Despite successfully gaining excursion after free muscle transfer for facial palsy, soft tissue asymmetry, especially around the nasolabial fold (NLF) and medial cheek, is a troublesome problem in elderly patients. An NLF reset technique that enhances miDFace lifts has been introduced to overcome this problem. Our study included 43 consecutive patients who underwent facial reanimation surgery with free functional muscle transfer between March 2015 and July 2017. Of these, 20 patients underwent conventional procedures and 23 underwent our NLF reset technique. Postoperative oral commissure excursion and symmetry at rest and while smiling were quantified using FACEgram (Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation) software. To detect soft-tissue changes after surgery, three-dimensional analysis was performed using Morpheus¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫, a 3D, LED-based, white-structured-light scanner. The NLF group had a significantly larger postoperative mean excursion at rest (control 25.32 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 2.80 mm vs NLF 27.42 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 3.60 mm; p = 0.047). The mean horizontal length ratios (affected-to-healthy) revealed better symmetry in the NLF group (resting 1.05 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.22, smiling 0.97 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.19; p = 0.201). The three-dimensional miDFace volume difference was significantly lower in the NLF group. The NLF reset technique produced improved surgical outcomes.

Brow reanimation techniques are used to recover a more natural appearance and brow function. Many static procedures have been set to augment brow elevation, but only dynamic procedures can lead to better functional results. In this study, the experience of a single surgeon addressing the challenge of brow restoration with dynamic procedures is presented. Methods: A retrospective review was performed using the records of 4 adult patients who underwent dynamic procedures using a soft tissue expander for brow restoration after arteriovenous malformation excision in the unilateral site of the forehead with the expander on the contralateral side. Movement and electrodiagnostic examinations were performed postoperatively at 2 months. Results: The patients included 3 males and 1 female (mean age, 20.5 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 4.04 years). Brow improvement was noted in all patients.

155,32049759,Pub-med,Suprazygomatic Aponeurotic McLaughlin Myoplasty for Facial Reanimation,"Background: Suprazygomatic aponeurotic McLaughlin (SAM) myoplasty technique for facial reanimation is based on the classical McLauglin's lengthening temporalis myoplasty with a series of new modifications. A comprehensive review of previously described other orthodromic temporalis myoplasty techniques is also included to give a succinct comparison. Methods: Twelve adult patients of facial palsy underwent SAM myoplasty for a period of 4 years. Three had congenital facial palsy, 4 patients had facial palsy secondary to acoustic neuromas, 3 were posttraumatic, and 2 patients had Bell's palsy. Results: Range of modiolus excursion achieved as measured at 3 months postoperatively on reanimation in our patients was 5 mm to 20 mm with an average of 12.6 mm. With SAM myoplasty technique, we were able to achieve excellent result in 4 patients and good results in 8 patients as evaluated with May and Druker scoring system. Conclusions: Suprazygomatic aponeurotic McLaughlin myoplasty for facial reanimation demonstrates a successful modification of the classical McLaughlin lengthening temporalis myoplasty, making it more customizable, simple, and predictable by taking the level of transection to the temporalis aponeurosis without the need for zygomatic osteotomy. A new classification of orthodromic temporalis myoplasty based on level of transections is also proposed for the first time.

Objective: To identify factors associated with health-related quality of life in patients with facial palsy. Design, setting, and participants: The inclusion period for participants in this cross-sectional study at the University Medical Center Groningen, a tertiary referral center for facial reanimation surgery, was March 1 to June 1, 2019. Patients aged at least 18 years with facial palsy who had undergone surgery for facial palsy between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2018, and patients visiting the outpatient clinic of the University of Groningen Department of Plastic Surgery for their facial palsy between March 1 and June 1, 2019, were also asked to participate. Of 276 patients invited, 145 gave informed consent. Twenty patients did not respond after consent, 3 patients withdrew from the study, and 1 patient was wrongly included. Main outcomes and measures: Health-related quality of life was measured using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale and the Facial Disability Index (physical score and social score). Facial function was assessed with the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System. Other variables were investigated using validated questionnaires, including the Duke University Religion Index, Ten-Item Personality Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multivariable linear regression analyses with stepwise backward selection were performed to identify associations with health-related quality of life. Because 44 Sunnybrook composite scores were missing, a sensitivity analysis was performed that excluded the Sunnybrook composite scores from the multivariable analysis.

158,32113740,Pub-med,A modified temporalis transfer technique for facial paralysis in elderly patients,"Introduction: In patients with chronic facial palsy where the treatment by conservative means or only nerve grafting is no longer an option, reconstruction by dynamic procedures such as pedicled and/or free muscle transfer is required. Patients and methods: Five patients with chronic facial palsy were treaded by temporalis muscle transfer to the eye and mouth simultaneously. In four of them, the combined Gillies-McLaughlin technique was used, but for the fifth one, a modified technique was applied. Results: In all patients, immediate and late postoperative clinical outcomes were satisfactory and improved their everyday quality of life. Discussion: Depending on the duration of the disease, there are different techniques that can be used. For the chronic facial palsy in elderly patients, the muscle transfer has better results, and a self-developed algorithm give us the opportunity to choose the best possible treatment for each one of our patients. The modified technique was found to be better with less surgical time, and recovery period for the patients. Conclusion: All the patients were satisfied with the results.

Methods: This thesis included a prospective study to be carried out on 15 patients with unilateral complete lower motor neuron facial paralysis (11 patients after cerebellopontine angle tumour resection and 4 patients after traumatic transverse petrous bone fracture) operated upon by end to end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis in Cairo university hospitals in the period between June 2015 and January 2017. Results: At one year follow up the improvement of facial nerve functions were as follows: Three cases (20%) had improved to House Hrackmann grade II, eleven cases (73.33%) had improved to grade III, and one patient (6.66%) had improved to House Brackmann grade IV. Conclusion: Despite the various techniques in facial reanimation following facial nerve paralysis, the end to end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis remains the gold standard procedure with satisfying results in cases of the viable distal facial stump and non-atrophic muscles.

Study design: Prospective observational study in a tertiary referral center. Patients treated via translabyrinthine surgical approach for sporadic AN microresection between December 2015 and 2018. Methods: Patients underwent preoperative (electroneurography-ENG, electromyography-EMG, and Blink Reflex-BR) and intraoperative (FN motor action potential-MAP and continuous EMG traces) neurophysiological studies. FN function was graded postoperatively at 1 year using House-Brackmann Scoring System. Results: Sixty-two patients were included in the analysis. Mean age was 53¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±10 years and average tumor diameter was 23 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 9 mm. At 1 year a normal facial function was observed in 68% of patients. In the univariate analysis a pathologic BR, low FN MAP values and ratios, and the presence of pathological neurotonic tracing (A-trains) on continuous EMG were associated with a poor facial nerve function outcome at 1 year postoperatively. Pathological preoperative BR testing and intraoperative A-trains showed a statistical significance also in the multivariable analysis, regardless of tumor size. Conclusions: Preoperative pathological BR testing and A-train activity on intraoperative EMG are correlated with poor FN outcomes at 1 year postoperative.

161,32266284,Pub-med,Functional Outcome and Quality of Life After Hypoglossal-Facial Jump Nerve Suture,"Background: To evaluate the face-specific quality of life after hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture for patients with long-term facial paralysis. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed. Forty-one adults (46% women; median age: 55 years) received a hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture. Sunnybrook and eFACE grading was performed before surgery and at a median time of 42 months after surgery. The Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) survey and the Facial Disability Index (FDI) were used to quantify face-specific quality of life after surgery. Results: Hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture was successful in all cases without tongue dysfunction. After surgery, the median FaCE Total score was 60 and the median FDI Total score was 76.3. Most Sunnybrook and eFACE grading subscores improved significantly after surgery. Younger age was the only consistent independent predictor for better FaCE outcome.

Options for these patients include free muscle transfer, temporalis myoplasty, and botulinum toxin injections for smile reanimation. In this study we aimed to evaluate the subjective and objective outcomes of these procedures. Materials and methods: In our study, we retrospectively analyzed smile symmetry in patients with facial palsy (n=8) who underwent facial reanimation procedures. Results: Subjective analysis showed high satisfaction in seven out of eight patients. Objective analysis showed statistically significant improvement postoperatively in both vertical and horizontal smile symmetry at rest and during maximum smile (P<0.001). Conclusion: Choosing the ideal procedure for the patients is the most critical aspect for facial reanimation.

163,32486859,Pub-med,Temporalis Tendon Transfer/Lengthening Temporalis Myoplasty for MiDFacial Static and Dynamic Reanimation After Head and Neck Oncologic Surgery,"Importance: Facial nerve paralysis is an unfortunate, yet relatively common sequela in the treatment of head and neck cancer. Static options for reanimation of the paralyzed miDFace and oral commissure offer limited quality-of-life improvement and may stretch over time. Reinnervation offers a prolonged recovery and may not be possible among patients with advanced cancer or in salvage situations. Objective: To determine the improvement in resting tone and dynamic excursion gained by use of temporalis tendon transfer (TTT) and lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM) for facial nerve reanimation among patients undergoing oncologic head and neck cancer surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: We present the largest series of primary and secondary TTT operations with prolonged photographic and video-based data with analysis enabled by FaceGram open-source quantitative methodology. This was achieved using preoperative and postoperative digital photographs of each patient at rest and full smile excursion. Using the JAVA-based program Facegram v1.0, measurements were taken of the oral commissure in relation to a line tangent to the inferior border of the lower lip. All operations were performed at the University of California, San Francisco, following oncologic resections between April 2011 and June 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Quantitative analysis of facial measurement with Facegram. Results: Of the 32 patients in our series, 19 (59.4%) were male and 13 (40.6%) were female. The average age was 71.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 10 years. There was a mean 4.89 mm (p < 0.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.78-6.99) increase in height of affected side oral commissure compared with preoperative measurements during full smile excursion, and a 3.05 mm (p < 0.04, 95% CI: 0.22-5.87) increase in horizontal excursion of smile vector. There was also a significant increase in static support at rest, measuring an average of 5.45 mm (p < 0.01, 95% CI: 2.56-8.33) and 2.71 mm (p < 0.04, 95% CI: 0.18-5.25) increase in affected oral commissure vertical and horizontal positions at rest, respectively. The average postoperative follow-up was 11.4 months (95% CI: 5.6-14.11). In addition, when compared with patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy (9 patients), those who received preoperative radiation (15 patients) had a significant improvement in the resting vertical height of the affected side (mean 5.32 mm (p < 0.05, 95% CI: 0.06-10.57)).

165,32543100,Pub-med,Nasolabial fold dynamics: Implications for facial paralysis and facial reanimation surgery,"Objectives: In patients with facial paralysis, facial reanimation surgery may be needed to normalize facial soft tissue function/movements. Critical for this normalization is the dynamics of the nasolabial folds (NLFs). The objective of this prospective, observational study was to determine the 3D morphologic dynamics of the NLFs in patients with unilateral facial palsy and normal subjects. Settings and sample population: 3D facial soft tissue movement data collected from adults with unilateral, facial paralysis (Bell's Palsy, n = 36); and (2) an age- and sex-frequency matched control group (n = 68). Materials and methods: Movement data were collected during repeated animations from participants using a video-based motion capture system. Movement in terms of displacement and asymmetry of the NLFs, nasal and circumoral regions were analyzed in the lateral, vertical and depth planes; as well as movement of the commissure and NLFs relative to the lower lip midline. Two-sample t tests were used to test for significant group differences. Results: Patients NLFs had less mean displacement, greater mean asymmetry and uncoordinated movements compared with the controls. For both groups during smiling, the NLF and commissure landmarks had approximately similar magnitudes of displacement (control range = 11-14mm; patient range = 7-10mm). Conclusion: NLF dynamics during smiling were as significant as oral commissure excursion. Thus, an immobile NLF is an unnatural feature of facial animations. Surgical treatments that address impaired NFL movements must be considered to create a more natural surgical outcome especially during smiling.",0,,0,0,3.0,9,1,2,0,10.1111/ocr.12400,Orthod Craniofac Res. 2021 Feb;24(1):62-69. doi: 10.1111/ocr.12400.

166,32561385,Pub-med,The mini-temporalis turnover flap for miDFace reanimation: Photogrammetric and patient-rated outcomes,"Background: Mini-temporalis transposition (MTT) flaps, modified from Gillies' technique, have become less popular than temporalis tendon transfers for miDFace reanimation. MTT involves raising the middle third of the temporalis, transposition over the zygomatic arch and lengthening with deep temporalis fascia which is sutured to the orbicularis oris. Aim: This retrospective study assessed subjective and objective outcomes following MTTs by a single surgeon from 2009 to 2019. Methods: Operative and surgical details were recorded. Four blinded consultants rated pre- and postoperative videos according to Terzis' scale. Pre- and postoperative resting, Mona Lisa and canine smile photographs were analysed using Emotrics, the software that automatically computes differences in inter-landmark distances. Patients also completed the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) patient-rated outcome measure. Results: Forty-one patients (mean age 65.8 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 15.5) underwent MTT, median 3 (0.4-57) years post-paralysis and were followed up for median of 2.2 (0.4-8.8) years.

The mean GBI was 35.19 with 17 (94.4%) patients reporting improvement, whereas one (5.6%) patient reported detriment after surgery. Two (5.4%) patients suffered complications: one haematoma and one infection. Four patients (9.8%) required revisional flap tightening. No patients requested revisional surgery for temporal hollowing or zygomatic fullness.

167,32596171,Pub-med,Results of End-To-Side Hypoglossal-Facial Nerve Anastomosis in Facial Paralysis after Skull Base Surgery,"Introduction: The primary aim of facial reanimation surgery is to restore tone, symmetry, and movement to the paralyzed face. Hypoglossal-facial end-to-side anastomosis provides satisfactory facial reanimation in the irreversible proximal injury of the facial nerve. This study discussed the facial function results of end-to-side anastomosing of hypoglossal nerve to facial nerve when the injury occurred during skull base surgery. Materials and methods: The present study enrolled a total of 10 patients who underwent end-to-side hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after facial nerve paralysis due to skull base surgery. The data of the patients were gathered from hospital records, pictures, and movies during the 18 months of follow-up. Results: At the 18 months of follow-up, seven (70%) and three (30%) patients were reported with grades III and IV of the House-Brackmann scoring system, respectively. In total, out of the seven grade III patients, six subjects underwent early anastomosis (within the first year of the paralysis). On the other hand, among patients with grade IV, two subjects had late anastomosis.

168,32917109,Pub-med,Early Outcomes in an Emerging Facial Nerve Center: The Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Experience,"Objectives: Nerve transfer (NT) and free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT) are procedures for reanimation of the paralyzed face. Assessing the surgical outcomes of these procedures is imperative when evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions, especially when establishing a new center focused on the treatment of patients with facial paralysis. We desired to discuss the factors to consider when implementing a facial nerve center and the means by which the specialist can assess and analyze outcomes. Methods: Patients with facial palsy secondary to multiple etiologies, including cerebellopontine angle tumors, head and neck carcinoma, and trauma, who underwent NT or FGMT between 2014 and 2019 were included. Primary outcomes were facial symmetry and smile excursion, calculated using FACE-gram and Emotrics software. Subjective quality of life outcomes, including the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale and Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), were also assessed. Results: 14/22 NT and 6/6 FGMT patients met inclusion criteria having both pre-and postoperative photo documentation. NT increased oral commissure excursion from 0.4 mm (SD 5.3) to 2.9 mm (SD 6.8) (P = 0.05), and improved symmetry of excursion (P < 0.001) and angle (P < 0.001). FGMT increased oral commissure excursion from -1.4 mm (SD 3.9) to 2.1 mm (SD 3.7), (P = 0.02), and improved symmetry of excursion (P < 0.001). FaCE scores improved in NT patients postoperatively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Measuring outcomes, critical analyses, and a multidisciplinary approach are necessary components when building a facial nerve center.

The biomechanics of primary TBI involve a direct impact, practically extended to the base of the skull, and most of the skull base fractures (SBF) are identified in anterior and medial cranial fossa. Furthermore, those predicted in the medial area are related to fissures from temporal bones. Presentation of case: We report two cases of right facial nerve palsy initiated by SBF's, which were diagnosed and treated at our institution. The 3D CT evaluation in our first case showed a longitudinal fracture of the right petrosal bone, which was longitudinal and transverse for the second case. Two cases of facial nerve palsy were managed with split hypoglossal facial anastomosis to restore functional reanimation. All patients were adequately achieved after the procedure, and the hypoglossal nerve function was preserved.

Besides that, they also succumb themselves to social isolation. Various techniques have been devised to overcome this devastating problem. The aim of this article is to evaluate and compare facial muscle function before and after facial reanimation with temporalis muscle galea pedicled flap by motion mode echomyography in patients with long-standing facial paralysis. Patients and methods: Ten patients with long-standing facial paralysis were included in the study (six patients with LMN palsy and four patients with facial weakness involving specific peripheral branches), and they subsequently underwent facial reanimation surgery with temporalis galea pedicled flap. These patients were followed postoperatively for a period of 1-2 years and were subjectively graded as excellent, good, fair and poor and objectively evaluated by M-mode echomyography, and the results were evaluated and statistically analyzed. Results: Subjectively, out of 6 patients with LMN palsy, results were graded as excellent in 2 cases, good in 3 cases, fair in 1 case, and out of 4 patients with weakness in specific facial nerve branches, the subjective results were excellent in 2 cases, good in 1 case and fair in 1 case. Objectively, the effect of transposed temporalis galea on orbicularis occuli, levator labii superioris and orbicularis oris was found to be statistically significant in patients with LMN palsy.

Dynamic facial reanimation methods have provided means of restoration of smile. There remains a dearth of quality of life data in children. The authors aim to assess patient reported outcomes in this underreported population. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of pediatric patients with facial palsy who had dynamic facial reanimation from 2009 to 2017 at a single institution. Patients were sent a digital Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) questionnaire, a validated tool to assess patient quality of life. FaCE statements are grouped into 6 categories: facial movement, facial comfort, oral function, eye comfort, lacrimal control, and social control. Results: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. Fourteen successfully completed the survey. With normal function being 100, our cohort scored: facial movement 38.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 14.3; facial comfort 67.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 23, oral function 75 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 22.7, eye comfort 68.75 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 18.2, lacrimal control 53.6 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 32.5, social function 64.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 25.6.

However, long-term evaluation of the results has not been critically examined in the international literature. Thus, it remains unknown how the transplanted flap changes with facial growth, and whether contraction (smiling) is maintained. Pediatric patients with Moebius syndrome who underwent facial animation surgery with at least 5 years of follow-up were retrospectively examined. Photographs taken at the 1-year and most recent follow-up visits were analyzed and compared using Emotrics software. Analyses focused on the rest position, and on gentle and maximum smiles. Eighteen patients were enrolled. Seven patients had bilateral and 11 unilateral Moebius syndrome; therefore, 25 gracilis transplants were analyzed. The latest follow-ups ranged from 5 to 13.2 years (mean 7.6 years). The three principal facial expressions that were examined did not differ significantly between 1 year and a mean of 7.6 years after surgery, but tended to improve in most patients.

We present the first detailed description and evaluation of a 2-stage technique, using first cross facial nerve graft and then the anterior belly of digastric muscle (ABDM), innervated by the cross facial nerve graft, to restore dynamic and spontaneous lower lip depression. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 2-stage lower lip reanimations between 2010 and 2018 was performed. Demographics, etiology, and operative details were recorded. Videos were graded pre/postoperatively using a 5-point Likert scale by 21 independent observers. Objective changes of symmetry were analyzed using Photogrammetry (Emotrics). Results: Twenty-seven patients were identified (median age 34.9 years, range 6-64). The mean duration between the 2 stages was 15.1 months. Follow-up ranged from 18-72 months. There were minor complications in 4 patients, and 1 case was abandoned due to insufficient length of anterior belly of digastric muscle. Average peer-reviewed scores improved from 2.1 to 3.2 (P < 0.05). Emotrics did not show improvement in static symmetry (P > 0.05). However, during open-lip smiling, lower lip height improved significantly (P < 0.05) whilst dental show improvements approached significance (P < 0.08). Lower lip symmetry was also improved during lower lip depression, as shown by improvements in lower lip height (P < 0.05), smile angle, and dental show (both P < 0.05).

However, these complex procedures sometimes result in cheek bulkiness owing to the double muscle transfer. We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with long-standing facial paralysis, who underwent two-stage facial reanimation using two superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle innervated by the masseteric and contralateral facial nerves via a sural nerve graft. Each muscle subslip was transferred to the upper lip and oral commissures, which were oriented in different directions. Furthermore, a horizontal fascia lata graft was added at the lower lip to prevent deformities such as lower lip elongation and deviation. Voluntary contraction was noted at roughly 4 months, and a spontaneous smile without biting was noted 8 months postoperatively. At 18 months after surgery, the patient demonstrated a spontaneous symmetrical smile with adequate excursion of the lower lip, upper lip, and oral commissure, without cheek bulkiness. Dual-innervated muscle transfer using two multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle may be a good option for long-standing facial paralysis, as it can achieve a symmetrical smile that can be performed voluntarily and spontaneously.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,2,3,0.0,9,4,1,0,10.5999/aps.2020.01599,Arch Plast Surg. 2021 May;48(3):282-286. doi: 10.5999/aps.2020.01599.

176,34062562,Pub-med,Maximizing the Smile Symmetry in Facial Paralysis Reconstruction: An Algorithm Based on Twenty Years' Experience,"Over the last two decades, the senior author (B.H.) has had an extensive experience with facial paralysis reconstruction. During this period, the techniques have evolved substantially based on the experience and after observing and analyzing the surgical outcomes. The purpose of this article is to relay the lessons learned from the 20 years' experience and suggest an algorithm. In this retrospective study, we have included 343 cases of facial paralysis cases. Complete facial paralysis cases were 285 and 58 were incomplete facial paralyses, both requiring surgical procedures. Complete facial paralyses were divided in to short term (n = 83) and long term (n = 202). In total, 58% of the patients were women and 42% were men. The age range was 6 to 82 years. The techniques employed were direct suture, nerve grafts, cross-facial nerve grafts (CFNGs), masseteric-to-facial nerve transference, hypoglossal-to-facial nerve transference, free muscle transplants, and lengthening temporal myoplasty to achieve the best symmetry after reanimation of unilateral, bilateral, complete, and incomplete facial paralysis. The type of paralysis, objective measurements, the personal patient's smile, and the gender are key concepts to be considered before scheduling a dynamic facial paralysis reconstruction. For unilateral facial paralysis, the time of onset, the type of paralysis, the patient's comorbidities, and the healthy side status are some of the determining factors when selecting the correct technique. The preferred techniques for unilateral facial paralysis are direct repair, CFNG, masseteric-to-facial transposition, and free gracilis transfer. For incomplete facial paralysis, the masseteric-to-facial nerve transference is preferred. In bilateral facial paralysis, bilateral free gracilis transfer is performed in two stages using the nerve of the masseter muscle as the source of innervation. The authors provide an algorithm which simplifies facial paralysis reconstruction to achieve the greatest facial symmetry while thinking about the potential comorbidities and developing spontaneity smile according to the gender of the patient.",4,,1,0,0.0,0,1,2,0,10.1055/s-0041-1722905,Facial Plast Surg. 2021 Jun;37(3):360-369. doi: 10.1055/s-0041-1722905.

This study aimed at evaluating an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven software as a novel video assessment tool for smile reanimation surgery and at comparing it with the Terzis score. Methods: Patients with facial paralysis undergoing smile reanimation surgery between January 2008 and April 2020 were eligible for this retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were at least 6 months of follow-up and availability of both pre- and post-operative video documentation. The software output was given as intensity score (IS) values between 0 and 1, representing emotions/action units (AUs) that are absent or fully present, respectively. Results: During the study period, 240 patients underwent facial reanimation surgery, of whom 63 patients met the inclusion criteria. Postoperatively, the median IS of the happiness emotion and lip corner puller AU increased significantly (p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation of Terzis score with the IS of happiness emotion (r = 0.8) and lip corner puller AU (r = 0.74).

Herein, we studied smile outcomes of a TTT technique via a single intraoral incision without external skin incisions. Objective: To measure the difference in static perioral positions before and after intraoral TTT. Methods: Five patients underwent an externally scarless TTT technique via an intraoral approach. Iris measurements were used to estimate pixel-to-millimeter conversion for facial analysis of vertical and horizontal oral commissure excursion vectors using the JAVA-based program Facegram version 1.0 (Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary). Results: After surgery, mean vertical height on the affected side significantly increased from 3.4 mm to a postoperative value of 20.6 mm, p = 0.016.

179,34558541,Pub-med,Facial reanimation with interposition nerve graft or masseter nerve transfer: a comparative retrospective study,"Both interposition nerve grafts and masseter nerve transfers have been successfully used for facial reanimation after irreversible injuries to the cranial portion of the facial nerve. However, no comparative study of these two procedures has yet been reported. In this two-site, two-arm, retrospective case review study, 32 patients were included. Of these, 17 patients (eight men and nine women, mean age 42.1 years) underwent interposition nerve graft after tumor extirpation or trauma between 2003 and 2006 in the Ear Institute, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, and 15 patients (six men and nine women, mean age 40.6 years) underwent masseter-to-facial nerve transfer after tumor extirpation or trauma between November 2010 and February 2016 in Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, China. More patients achieved House-Brackmann III recovery after masseter nerve repair than interposition nerve graft repair (15/15 vs. 12/17). The mean oral commissure excursion ratio was also higher in patients who underwent masseter nerve transfer than in patients subjected to an interposition nerve graft. These findings suggest that masseter nerve transfer results in strong oral commissure excursion, avoiding obvious synkinesis, while an interposition nerve graft provides better resting symmetry.

180,34760845,Pub-med,Two-Stage Dual-Nerve Facial Reanimation: Outcomes and Complications in a Series of Pediatric Patients,"Background: In facial reanimation via microneurovascular muscle transfer, dual-nerve reinnervation of the muscle capitalizes on the synergistic effects of spontaneous motion from cross facial nerve grafting (CFNG) and increased excursion from masseteric nerve transfer. Two-stage approaches that delay masseteric nerve transfer until the time of the muscle flap increase spontaneity by maximizing muscle reinnervation from the CFNG. While this 2-stage, dual-nerve approach has been described in adults, we present a series of pediatric patients who underwent this reconstructive technique. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients who underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction with CFNG and ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfers. Procedures were performed between 2004 and 2016 by 2 surgeons at a single centre. Degree of facial paralysis before and after surgical intervention was measured using House-Brackmann scores. Results: Nine patients with a mean age of 8.6 (range: 5-15 years) years at time of surgery underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction. Average time between CFNG and transfer of the free gracilis with masseteric nerve transfer was 13.3 (SD 2.4) months. Mean follow-up was 27.3 months (SD 25.7). Patients demonstrated initiation of voluntary movement on paralyzed side by 3.6 months (SD 0.6) on average, with 3 patients demonstrating spontaneous movement at 3 months. Conclusion: The 2-stage, dual innervation technique using CFNG and delayed ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfer with a free gracilis is a promising reconstructive option to maximize spontaneous expression in pediatric patients.

We aimed to analyze long-term outcome and complications of this procedure. Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing SCM reanimation for longstanding facial palsy between January 2009 and December 2015. Patients with follow-up longer than 12 months (range=12-96) were included in the study. Facial muscle function was evaluated before and at each follow-up after the surgery with the House-Brackmann (HB) scale-facial nerve grading system and Facegram analysis. Donor site morbidity and overall complication rates were documented and analyzed. Results: Forty-two patients aged 18-66 years (mean age=37) with a mean duration of facial palsy of 5 years (range=2-48) met the inclusion criteria. The HB score 2 years after surgery improved significantly (p<0.05) in comparison to the pre-operative condition (3.6 vs. 4.7). Twelve months after surgery, oral commissure excursion improved by mean 8.95 mm. No flap necrosis occurred, nor compromise of neck and shoulder function despite an obvious contour defect in the SCM donor site. None of the patients presented head posture or movement issues.

However, this technique may result in hemitongue atrophy. The ansa cervicalis, which arises from the cervical plexus, is also used for facial reanimation. We retrospectively reviewed cases where facial reanimation was performed using the ansa cervicalis to overcome the shortcomings of existing techniques of hypoglossal nerve transfer. Methods: The records of 15 patients who underwent hypoglossal nerve transfer were retrospectively reviewed. Three methods were used: facial reanimation with hypoglossal nerve transfer (group 1), facial nerve reanimation using the ansa cervicalis (group 2), and sural nerve interposition grafting between the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerve (group 3). In group 1, the ansa cervicalis was coapted to neurotize the distal stump of the hypoglossal nerve in a subset of patients. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system and Emotrics software.

Various surgical facial reanimation techniques have been described to address this devastating condition. While traditional surgical approaches have proved successful in restoring either facial tone or facial movement, newer combination nerve transfer techniques are addressing the limitations of the traditional single nerve transfer approaches. Methods: This study aimed to describe a promising new surgical approach to facial reanimation utilizing a dual nerve transfer to maximize both resting and active symmetry while minimizing postoperative synkinesis. Here, we use the masseteric nerve to selectively innervate the miDFace in combination with a hypoglossal facial nerve graft to reanimate the remaining facial regions. Results: To date, we have performed this operation on four patients, all of whom tolerated the procedure well.

In clinical observation, patients with different levels of oral commissure drooping achieve different symmetry outcomes, despite undergoing the same surgical procedure. Patients with slight asymmetry obtain better outcomes than those with severe asymmetry. The mechanisms influencing postoperative outcomes have not been systematically explored. We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients performed with masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension. Patients were divided into two groups according to the level of oral commissure drooping: slight-asymmetry group (n = 24) and severe-asymmetry group (n = 20). Static and dynamic symmetry were assessed with FACE-gram software pre and postoperatively. The symmetry of the oral commissures at rest and during smiling significantly improved postoperatively in all patients. The differences of the bilateral oral commissure positions were significantly smaller in slight-asymmetry group than that in severe-asymmetry group (p<0.001), indicating that slight-asymmetry group achieved better symmetry. Furthermore, these differences were caused by the oral commissures position on the unaffected side, both pre and postoperatively (p<0.001), but not the paralyzed side's (p>0.05). In conclusion, masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension achieved dynamic and static symmetry in patients with different levels of asymmetry. Patients with slight asymmetry obtained better postoperative symmetry than those with severe asymmetry.

The masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer (MFNT) has many advantages in facial reanimation. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of our MFNT technique and define the potential factors predictive of outcome. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients who underwent MFNT using the temporofacial trunk of facial nerve. Videotapes and images were documented and evaluated according to Facial Nerve Grading Scale 2.0 (FNGS2.0) and Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (FGS). The quality-of-life was obtained using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale. Moreover, Facial Asymmetry Index (FAI), quantitative measurement of the width of palpebral fissure, deviation of the philtrum, and angles or excursions of the oral commissure were applied to explore the effect of the transfer metrically. Multivariable logistic regression models and Cox regression were prepared to predict the effect of MFNT by preoperative clinical features. The patients showed favorable outcomes graded by FNGS2.0, and experienced significantly improved scores in static and dynamic symmetry with slightly elevated scores in synkinesis evaluated by the Sunnybrook FGS. The score of FaCE Scale increased in all domains after reanimation. The quantitative indices indicated the symmetry restoration of the middle and lower face after MFNT. Regression analysis revealed that younger patients with severe facial paralysis are preferable to receive MFNT early for faster and better recovery, especially for traumatic causes.

The results of this approach were hitherto unquantified. Methods: This study retrospectively assessed peer-reviewed, patient-rated and objective outcomes following staged reanimation in adults between 2010 and 2020. Demographics, palsy characteristics and surgery details were recorded. Pre- and postoperative videos were rated by independent assessors using Terzis' aesthetic and symmetry scale. Photographs were analysed using Emotrics and patients completed the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) patient-rated outcome measure. Results: Ten patients [mean age = 34 (SD = 12.48)] were eligible. All regained lip elevation and depression. All markers of symmetry improved after gracilis transfer. All markers were also improved after ABDMT except for lower lip height when smiling with teeth showing (p > 0.05). Five patients (50%) responded to the GBI (mean score = +39.44).
