Pub-med,Pectoralis minor: a unique muscle for correction of facial palsy,"The author introduced this muscle for the first time almost a decade ago, and this is the first extensive description of the intricate microanatomy of this complex but unique microneurovascular muscle unit. Advantages and disadvantages and indications and contraindications for its use in facial paralysis are presented in detail from an extensive clinical experience of almost 50 such microneurovascular transfers. Pitfalls that the reconstructive microsurgeon should beware and strengths in using this muscle for facial palsy are highlighted. The detailed operative approach is presented, with promise of undetectable scars and minimal functional loss. The strategies for how to inset this muscle unit in the new recipient site are given, along with the thought processes involved in selecting the actual sites of anchoring the muscle to reproduce a mirror image of the contralateral normal face. Finally, an exemplary clinical case demonstrating the use of the pectoralis minor muscle for both eye and lower face reanimation is presented in detail, demonstrating the dual nerve supply and the resulting independent eye and smile movements with total lack of mass action and/or synkinesis. Restorations of eye blink and of a symmetrical and coordinated smile are the frequent rewards of using this unique muscle for the correction of facial palsy.",0,,0,0,1,9,4,1,0,,Plast Reconstr Surg. 1989 May;83(5):767-76.,Terzis JK.,1989,2710828,"Tools: clinical evaluation Outcomes: advantages, disadvantages, and complications of muscle tranfer, smile, synkinesis, eye blink, symmetry",50,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Results of management of facial palsy with microvascular free-muscle transfer,"This paper reports our experience in facial reanimation using free innervated muscle transfer in 69 patients with long-term facial palsy. The majority of patients were treated in two stages with cross-facial nerve graft as the first stage and microvascular muscle transfer at the second stage. The gracilis muscle was used in 62 patients. A system of grading results has been utilized in the long-term evaluation. The overall final result was excellent or good in 51 percent of 47 patients who were available for follow-up. Although the results are not completely satisfactory, they justify the use of this approach to a difficult clinical problem. The results are improving as technical modifications to the procedure have evolved. The gracilis muscle is a reliable free transfer with internal anatomy conductive to use for reanimation of the paralyzed face. This type of transfer, in our experience, has proved superior to nonmicrosurgical methods for treatment of complete and severe incomplete facial palsy. The seventh cranial nerve is used in the innervation of the transferred muscle, the ipsilateral being preferable if available. The authors believe that use of the same cranial nerve is superior to methods that involve other cranial nerves, where spontaneity is often not achieved.",1,,0,0,9,9,8,1,0,,Plast Reconstr Surg. 1990 Jul;86(1):12-22; discussion 23-4.,"O'Brien BM, Pederson WC, Khazanchi RK, Morrison WA, MacLeod AM, Kumar V.",1990,2359779,"neg: hematoma, vascular complications",69,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,One-stage microneurovascular free abductor hallucis muscle transplantation for reanimation of facial paralysis,"We introduce a new method using abductor hallucis muscle free transplantation for reanimation of the cheek with long-standing facial palsy in six young patients. The muscle is used to reanimate facial palsy because it has many unique advantages: (1) appropriate size and shape of the muscle and adequate bulk, (2) closely parallel alignment and unvaried anatomy of the main vessels and nerve distribution to the muscle, (3) a long neurovascular pedicle, (4) easy surgical isolation of the muscle and its neurovascular pedicle, and (5) no functional deficit after muscle removal. The nerve and muscle grafts can be performed by microneurovascular anastomosis in one surgical procedure. The follow-up period was over 1 year. A satisfactory result was obtained in five of six patients.",0,,2,0,0,9,8,1,0,,Plast Reconstr Surg. 1995 Jul;96(1):78-85.,"Jiang H, Guo ET, Ji ZL, Zhang ML, Lu V.",1995,7604134,"smile, symmetry,clinical evaluation, EMG",6,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,['Abductor hallucis flap'],Abductor hallucis flap,,
Embase,Management of 1000 vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas): The facial nerve - Preservation and restitution of function,"OBJECTIVE: Although the rate of reported facial nerve preservation after surgery for vestibular schwannomas continuously increases, facial nerve paresis or paralysis is a frequent postsurgical sequelae of major concern. The major goal of this study was to define criteria for the right indication, timing, and type of therapy for patients with palsies despite anatomic nerve continuity and those with loss of anatomic continuity. METHODS: One thousand vestibular schwannomas were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery at Nordstadt Hospital from 1978 to 1993. Of 979 cases of complete removal and 21 cases of deliberately partial removal, the facial nerve was anatomically preserved in 929 cases (93%). The rate of preservation is increasing, as is evidenced in the most recent cases, and preservation is supported by special electrophysiological monitoring. The facial nerve was anatomically severed in 60 cases (6%). It was anatomically lost in previous operations that were performed elsewhere in 11 cases (1%). In case of nerve discontinuity (42 cases), immediate nerve reconstruction by one of three available intracranial procedures (within the cerebellopontine angle, intracranial-intratemporal, intracranial-extracranial) was performed in the same surgical setting. In case of loss of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem, early reanimation by combination with the hypoglossal nerve was achieved in most patients within weeks after tumor surgery. In a few patients with anatomic nerve continuity but absence of reinnervation for 10 to 12 months, a hypoglossal-facial combination was applied. All the patients with partial or with complete palsies were treated in a special follow-up program of regular controls and of modulation of physiotherapeutic treatment every 3 to 6 months. RESULTS: In intracranial nerve reconstruction at the cerebellopontine angle, 61 to 70% of patients regained complete eye closure and an overall result equivalent to House-Brackmann Grade 3. Hypoglossal- facial reanimation led to Grade 3 in 79%. The duration between the onset of paralysis and the reconstructive procedure is decisive for the quality of the outcome. These data are discussed in view of other treatment options and certain parameters influencing outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This management contains three major principles as follows: 1) preservation of facial nerve continuity in function by the aid of intraoperative monitoring, 2) early nerve reconstruction in case of lost continuity, and 3) scheduled follow-up program for all patients with incomplete or complete palsies.",3,,0,0,9,9,2,1,0,10.1097/00006123-199704000-00006,Neurosurgery (1997) 40:4 (684-695).

Pub-med,Facial reanimation after temporal bone fracture,"Fracture of the temporal bone is usually associated with skull injury and the patient is initially seen in the emergency room. As a result the diagnosis of facial paralysis may be delayed. The aim of this study is to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of facial paralysis in such cases. Between 1990 and 1996, sixteen patients with facial paralysis due to temporal bone fracture were operated on within one month of trauma. The surgical technique was selected on the basis of the location of fallopian canal involvement and the patients hearing status. Six patients had grade VI, 7 had grade V and 3 had grade IV facial weakness preoperatively. Twelve patients had serviceable hearing. 9 of them underwent facial decompression through the transmastoid approach and 3 were operated on via the middle fossa approach. Four patients with unserviceable hearing had the operation through the translabyrinthine route. Postoperatively, 15 out of sixteen patients gained normal facial function while one had grade III facial weakness. Severe grade and sudden onset facial paralysis after temporal bone fracture should be surgically corrected as early as possible. The site of involvement of the facial canal and patient's hearing status should be considered in deciding the type of surgery to be applied.",0,,0,0,0,9,8,1,0,,Rev Laryngol Otol Rhinol (Bord). 1998;119(5):313-6.,"Goksu N, Bayazit AY, Beder L, Sirik‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫i A.",1998,10089800,"Tools: clinical evaluation, HB score Outcomes: facial function, hearing status",16,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Revascularized muscle transfer for facial reanimation after long-standing facial paralysis,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the results of a group of patients who had received free vascularized muscle transfer to the face for the treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. In 15 patients, neurovascular transfer of 16 segments of the gracilis muscle to the cheek was performed for reanimation of oral commissure movement. Voluntary muscle activation was evaluated by electromyography (EMG) and clinical function was assessed both metrically from frontal photographs and by a rating system with 6 categories. Patient satisfaction was explored through a self-administered questionnaire of general health (SF-36 health survey). The average follow-up period was 49.3 months. All patients showed voluntary activation of the grafted muscles in the EMG. Symmetry of the static and dynamic position of the oral commissure at rest and under function was considerably improved. In general, however, there was a tendency for undercorrection particularly in a vertical direction. Under function, the excursion of the oral commissure on the grafted side reached 63.7% and 65.5% of the nonparetic side in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. Subjective rating of patient well-being showed that the scores were higher than or comparable to those of healthy adults in six of eight areas of evaluation.",0,,1,1,0,9,8,3,0,,Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2000 Aug;29(4):243-9.,"Schliephake H, Schmelzeisen R, Tr‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°ger M.",2000,11030393,"Tools:EMG, clinical evaluation, Self administered questionnaire for general health (DF-36)Outcomes:patient satisfaction, excursion of the oral commissure, ",15,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,Hypoglossal-facial crossover in facial-nerve palsy: Pure end-to-side anastomosis technique,"Hypoglossal-facial crossover is the most popular method of reconstructing the facial nerve in facial palsy resulting from proximal facial-nerve injury near the brainstem. Conventional hypoglossal-facial crossover involves performing a partial hypoglossal-nerve section or incision and an interpositional nerve graft to bridge the gap between the two nerves, which sometimes results in hemiglossal atrophy and its sequelae. Furthermore, the nerve graft may delay recovery and make facial reanimation weak. To solve these problems, we attempted to perform 'pure end-to-side anastomosis' (without section of the hypoglossal nerve) between the hypoglossal and facial nerves in four patients with facial palsy. In two patients (group I) a sural-nerve graft was used to bridge the gap between the two nerves. In the other two patients (group II) the intratemporal facial nerve was mobilised to the neck and one tension-free end-to-side anastomosis was performed. Facial symmetry and tone at rest were restored in all cases. Facial reanimation was achieved in group II after 8 months. Despite the small number of cases, we believe that the technique of hypoglossal-facial crossover with 'pure end-to-side anastomosis' and mobilisation of the intratemporal facial nerve can decrease donor-nerve morbidity in facial-nerve rehabilitation. ¬¨¬© 2002 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.",3,,0,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1054/bjps.2001.3727,British Journal of Plastic Surgery (2002) 55:1 (25-31).

Pub-med,[Results of 13 hypoglosso-facial anastomoses],"Background and purpose: Facial nerve paralysis significantly decreases the quality of life in patients after skull base tumors surgery. There are different options for surgical repair of the nerve. One of the most effective methods is the anastomosis of the distal trunk of the facial nerve with the proximal trunk of the hypoglossal nerve or with hypoglossal loop. Material and methods: Thirteen hypoglosso-facial anastomoses had been performed in our department between 1999 and 2003. In all patients the facial nerve paralysis was due to the surgery in its proximity. In one case the patient suffered from petroclival chordoma, in one case ameloblastoma, one was with petroclival meningioma and the rest of cases were after vestibular schwannoma. The follow-up period lasted from 6 months to three years. The final result was expressed in House-Brackmann scale (HB) describing facial muscle strength. Results: In two cases there was no improvement (HB 6), in two cases barely perceptible motion (HB 5), in five obvious weekness with disfiguring assymetry (HB 4) and in four obvious but not disfiguring dysfunction (HB 3). There was only one postoperative complication haematoma at the place of anastomosis requiring evacuation. Conclusion: Hypoglosso-facial anastomosis remains one of the most important techniques of the reanimation of the paralysed face.

Embase,Masseteric-facial nerve coaptation - an alternative technique for facial nerve reinnervation,"Background: Reinnervation of the facial musculature when there is loss of the proximal facial nerve poses a difficult clinical problem. Restoration of spontaneous mimetic motion is the aim and, to this end, the use of cross-facial nerve grafts has long been considered the reconstruction of choice. The nerve to masseter has been used very successfully for reinnervation of microvascular functioning muscle transfers for facial reanimation in established facial palsy but its use as a direct nerve transfer to the facial nerve to reinnervate 'viable' facial musculature has been scarce. Methods: Electron micrographic studies of axonal counts in the nerve to masseter and nerve to gracilis in a clinical series of seven patients undergoing surgery for facial nerve palsy were made. Based on these results, and previous success with the use of the nerve to masseter for reinnervation of free gracilis transfers, we report our experience with the transfer of the nerve to masseter for direct coaptation with the ipsilateral facial nerve to restore facial motion. Results: Our axonal counts of the nerve to masseter have, on average, 1542 ¬¨¬± 291.70 (SD) axons. Historical data have shown that the buccal branch of the facial nerve has 834 ¬¨¬± 285 (SD) where the distal end of a cross-facial nerve graft has 100 to 200 axons. Our clinical use of the nerve to masseter as a direct nerve transfer in three patients based on these data has resulted in significant improvement in facial symmetry in repose (at a minimum of 1 year follow up), restoration of facial motion with occasional spontaneous activity and minimal synkinesis without any donor morbidity. Conclusions: The advantages of this technique include the ease of dissection, constant and reliable anatomy, powerful reinnervation of the facial muscles without donor site morbidity and the potential for return of spontaneous facial movement.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review with 18 consecutive patients who underwent gracilis muscle flap transfer with or without the use of a GIA stapler. Results: Of 11 operations with the GIA stapler, one patient developed a hematoma (donor site) and another required drainage of an abscess (recipient site). Of 8 operations without the use of the stapler, one patient had total flap failure and three required drainage of an abscess (2 recipient sites and 1 donor site). These differences trended toward improvement but were not statistically different. Conclusions: The use of the GIA stapler is a fast, safe technique. Larger studies are, however, warranted to further examine this novel approach in order to test precisely what factors of increased efficiency occur, the amount of suture pull-through, and overall tension capable of being applied to the secured staple line.",0,,1,1,6,9,4,1,0,,Eplasty. 2010 Apr 8;10:e29.,"Shridharani SM, Stapleton SM, Redett RJ, Magarakis M, Rosson GD.",2010,20396379,"Tools: clinical evaluation Outcomes: amount of compliacations, return of function  ",18,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

The current gold standard in facial reanimation is revascularized re-innervated muscle transfers. Materials and methods: In this paper, we report the results of a new method using the gracilis flap with a double innervation on the masseter motor nerve and the controlateral facial nerve via a sural graft in a single stage intervention, on a series of six patients. Results: No failure was observed. The average delay of a voluntary contraction was 3.8. months, and 7.2. months for a spontaneous one. Three of the six patients had ""excellent"" results according to the Terzis and Noah classification, two were classified as ""good"" and one ""average"" Discussion: A choice is to be made between a method advocating a natural and spontaneous dynamicity (controlateral facial nerve stimulus) and a method focusing on the quality and quantity of contractions (ipsilateral trijeminal stimulus). In this new technique, we combine the two methods: a free gracilis transfer with a dual innervation on the healthy controlateral facial nerve via a sural graft, on one hand, and a second anastomosis on the ipsilateral masseter nerve, on the other hand. Conclusion: This new proposed method seems to be, according to our results, a reliable technique rallying voluntary contraction and emotional smile. ¬¨¬© 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,3,0,9,2,1,0,10.1016/j.anplas.2012.12.001,Annales de Chirurgie Plastique et Esthetique (2013) 58:2 (89-95).

Pub-med,Contralateral botulinum injections in patients with residual facial asymmetry and contralateral hyperkinesis after primary facial palsy surgery,"Aim: In patient with facial paralysis, facial appearance and muscular ability are impaired, and the psychological integrity is affected. Botulinum toxin A may be used to improve facial symmetry in patients suffering with facial palsy reducing the progressive contralateral hyperkinesis and facial asymmetry after primary surgery for facial paralysis. Material of study: Six patients, whom have been suffering unilateral facial palsy with an House-Brackmann score grade from III to VI, were included in this study for a residual facial asymmetry and contralateral hyperkinesis after previous facial reanimation. They were treated with 50 units of botulinum toxin type A injected in muscles of the unaffected side of face to improve muscular ability and facial symmetry. Results: This study demonstrated reduction in contralateral hyperkinesis and facial asymmetry that lasted approximately 120 days. All patients reported satisfactory results with the treatment. Comments: Botulinum toxin type A injections improved facial asymmetry and muscular function in all patients. Discussion and comments: Botulinum toxin type A injections may be an indispensable technique as a nonsurgical treatment or as a complementary measure in postsurgical treatments and should be certainly considered for temporary or permanent asymmetries in patients who suffer from facial palsy. Conclusions: Contralateral botulinum toxin type A injection was useful in reducing muscular hyperkinesis in patients with residual facial asymmetry after primary surgery for facial palsy, improving aesthetic and functional facial recovery with not widely common adverse events.",0,,0,0,0,1,4,1,1,,Ann Ital Chir. 2015 May-Jun;86(3):201-6.,"Bartoli D, Battisti A, Cassoni A, Terenzi V, Della Monaca M, Pagnoni M, Valentini V, Priore P.",2015,26229045,,6,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,Reconstruction of complex defects of the extracranial facial nerve: technique of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫the trifurcation approach‚Äö√Ñ√π,"Purpose: Reconstruction of complex defects of facial nerve (FN) after extensive cancer surgery requires individualized solutions. We describe the trifurcation technique as a modification of the combined approach on example of two patients with locally advanced parotid cancer. Methods: Due to perineural invasion, extensive resection of the FN from the mastoid segment to the peripheral branches was required. For reanimation of the upper face, a complex cervical plexus graft was sutured end-to-end to the mastoid segment of the FN trunk. The branches of the graft enabled reanimation of three peripheral temporal and zygomatic branches. The mandibular branch was sutured end-to-side to the hypoglossal nerve (hypoglossal‚Äö√Ñ√¨facial nerve transfer, HFNT). Additionally, the buccal branch was independently reanimated with ansa cervicalis. Results: Facial reanimation was successful in both patients. Good resting tone and voluntary movement were achieved with a mild degree of synkinesis after 13¬¨‚Ä†months. Patient 1 showed the Sunnybrook (SB) composite score 69 [76 (voluntary movement score) ‚Äö√†√≠ 0 (resting symmetry score) ‚Äö√†√≠ 7 (synkinesis score)]. In patient 2, the SB composite score was 76 (80 ‚Äö√†√≠ 0 ‚Äö√†√≠ 4, respectively). Conclusions: In this trifurcation approach, cervical cutaneous plexus provides a long complex nerve graft, which allows bridging the gap between proximal FN stump and several peripheral branches without great expenditure.

Pub-med,Cross-face nerve grafting followed by free muscle transplantation in young patients with long-standing facial paralysis. Reanimation of the cheek and the angle of the mouth,"For reanimation of the cheek in 8 young patients with long-standing facial palsy a method with cross-face nerve grafting followed by free muscle transplantation has been used. The sural nerve was used as nerve graft and placed in a subcutaneous tunnel across the face. In the normal cheek 3-4 fascicles of the nerve were anastomosed to facial nerve branches innervating muscles elevating the angle of the mouth. Four to 13 months later the extensor digitorum brevis muscle to the second toe or the palmaris longus was transplanted to the paralysed cheek. It was attached between the zygomatic arch and the angle of the mouth. The end of the nerve was sutured to the muscle after taking a biopsy. The follow-up period has been 7-30 months. At 7 months 6 patients had positive EMG, either on voluntary movement or on stimulation of the contralateral facial nerve. Three of them had also a slight movement in the cheek. Two patients are as yet only 7 months postoperative. In the remaining two cases, No. 2 and 4, there were no signs of reinnervation. At 18 months 4 out of 6 patients had a synchronous natural contraction in the cheek giving increased balance to the mouth. These patients had a positive EMG. In patients No. 2 and 4 there was neither innervation nor improvement. At 30 months there was additional improvement in two cases but as previously in patients No. 2 and 4 there was neither improvement nor signs of innervation of the muscle on the EMG.

Pub-med,Paralyzed face. Ansa-cervicalis-nervi-hypoglossi,"Introduction: For 100 years hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HFA) has been a common surgical procedure for reanimation of paralyzed mimic muscles of the face after axotomy of the facial nerve. However, the denervation and subsequent scarred degeneration of the target muscles of the hypoglossal nerve often results in unfavorable late effects for speech and swallowing. Therefore, the ansa cervicalis nervi hypoglossi-facial nerve anastomosis (ACHFA) can be an alternative to avoid such late effects. As a branch of the hypoglossal nerve the ansa cervicalis innervates the infrahyoidal muscles. Neck dissection surgery proved that resection of the ansa cervicalis causes no side effects for swallowing because of several nerve anastomoses to the cervical plexus. Patients and method: We compared our clinical results of eight cases following a delayed ACHFA with our own experiences after HFA and results from the literature. Results: We found a reanimation rate lower than usually seen after HFA only in the target muscles of the forehead. This may be caused by a reduced neuronal plasticity of the ansa cervicalis. However, in the target muscles of the other two facial nerve branches we observed the same good results one would expect after HFA. There were no late side effects for swallowing and speech though.",3,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,10.1007/s00104-004-0883-z,Chirurg. 2005 Jan;76(1):47-53. doi: 10.1007/s00104-004-0883-z.,"Schipper J, Arndt S, Maier W, Spetzger U, Ridder GJ.",2005,15205750,,8,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,anastomosis,ansa cervicalis",,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Cross-Face Nerve Grafting versus Masseteric-to-Facial Nerve Transposition for Reanimation of Incomplete Facial Paralysis: A Comparative Study Using the FACIAL CLIMA Evaluating System,"Background: Incomplete facial paralysis is still a challenge because we must restore what is missing without causing damage to what has recovered. The current literature is insufficient, with a small number of cases. The use of nerve transfers has gained recent popularity for reanimating facial palsy. The authors present a comparative study between cross-face nerve grafting and masseteric-to-facial nerve transposition for incomplete facial paralysis. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with incomplete unilateral facial paralysis were reanimated with either cross-face nerve grafting (group I, n = 10) or masseteric nerve transfer (group II, n = 18). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the FACIAL CLIMA dystem. Spontaneity of the movement and satisfaction were also assessed. Results: When comparing the reconstructed and the healthy sides, statistical differences were found in group I but not in group II, suggesting that the resulting movement was symmetrical in group II but not in group I. Intergroup comparison showed that both commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were higher in group II. Spontaneity in group I was higher than in group II, but patients in group II showed more satisfaction, both without being statistically significant. Conclusions: Reanimation of incomplete facial paralysis can be satisfactorily achieved with both cross-face nerve grafting and direct masseteric-to-facial nerve transposition. However, with the masseteric nerve, better symmetry, a higher degree of recovery, and an increased level of satisfaction are achieved in a one-stage operation. Furthermore, both nerve sources are able to restore spontaneity in more than 50 percent of the patient's daily life, with no significant differences between them.

Pub-med,Electromyographic evaluation of the facial and motor donor nerves before facial reanimation surgery in Moebius syndrome,"Background: Moebius syndrome is a clinical entity characterized by bilateral facial and abducens nerve palsies; other cranial nerver might be affected as well. So far, no studies have reported the electromyographic responses of the facial musculature in this group of patients. Objective: The objective of our study is to describe the electromyographic responses of the facial muscle and the main donor nerves for facial reanimation in patients with Moebius syndrome. Method: We analyzed electromyographies from the facial, hypoglossal, masseterine (trigeminal) and accessory nerves from patients with Moebius syndrome treated between 2010 and 2016. Results are presented as percentages and central tendency measures. Results: 24 patients were included, mean age 11.79 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 9.39 years. The facial nerve showed complete unilateral recruitment in 4 patients, partial bilaterally in 11, 7 showed no activity bilaterally and two had unilateral inactivity. The masseterine was normal in 14 patients, had partial recruitment bilaterally in 4 and unilaterally in 4 cases. The accessory nerve was normal in 20 patients, showed partial recruitment bilaterally in 3 and unilaterally in 1 patients. The hypoglossal was normal in 22 patients, and altered in 2 cases. Conclusion: Patients with Moebius syndrome show several degrees of alteration in electromyographic evaluation of the facial nerve.

Pub-med,"Facial Palsy, Radiographic and Other Workup Negative: FROWN","Objectives: Slow-onset peripheral facial palsy is far less common than acute-onset peripheral facial palsy and necessitates diagnostic evaluation for benign or malignant tumors or other less common etiologies. In the rare scenario in which no clarifying etiology is discovered following long-term evaluation (no radiographic or hematologic abnormalities and an otherwise unremarkable evaluation), a diagnostic and management dilemma occurs. We present a series of patients with this possible new clinical entity: Facial palsy, Radiographic and Other Workup Negative (FROWN) and propose a management strategy for this diagnosis of exclusion. Methods: A series of 3,849 patients presenting with facial palsy to a tertiary facial nerve center was retrospectively assessed to identify those with progressive loss of facial function over at least 1 month. Exclusion criteria were history, physical or hematologic findings indicative of known diseases associated with facial palsy, and radiographic studies demonstrating a benign or malignant tumor. Results: Patients with slow-onset facial palsy constituted 5% (190 patients) of the cohort and were ultimately diagnosed with either a benign or malignant neoplasm or other facial nerve pathology. Fourteen patients with slow-onset facial palsy remained without a diagnosis following long-term evaluation and serial imaging. Eleven patients underwent dynamic facial reanimation surgery and facial nerve and muscle biopsy, with no clear histopathologic diagnosis. Conclusion: Patients with slow-onset facial palsy with negative radiographic and medical evaluations over several years may be characterized as having FROWN, an idiopathic and as yet poorly understood condition, which appears to be amenable to facial reanimation but requires further investigation as to its pathophysiology.",0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,10.1212/CPJ.0000000000001020,Neurol Clin Pract. 2021 Oct;11(5):e654-e660. doi: 10.1212/CPJ.0000000000001020.,"Greene JJ, Sadjadi R, Jowett N, Hadlock T.",2021,34840879,"Tools: Facial palsy, Radiographic and Other Workup Negative (FROWN) retrospective cohort of facial palsy pts",14,,,retrospective cohort of facial palsy pts,retrospective cohort of facial palsy pts,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Interposition Grafting of the Facial Nerve After Resection of a Large Facial Nerve Schwannoma: 2-Dimensional Operative Video,"Facial nerve schwannomas can develop at any portion of the facial nerve.1 When arising from the mastoid portion of the facial nerve, the tumor will progressively erode the mastoid, giving the schwannoma an aggressive radiological appearance.1,2 The facial nerve is frequently already paralyzed, or no fascicles can be saved during resection. In these cases, end-to-end interposition grafting is the best option for facial reanimation.1,3-5 The healthy proximal and distal facial nerves are prepared prior to grafting. The great auricular nerve is readily available near the surgical site and represents an excellent graft donor with minimal associated morbidity.4,6 We demonstrate this technique through a case of a 48-yr-old male who presented with a complete right-sided facial nerve palsy due to a large facial schwannoma that invaded the mastoid and extended to the hypoglossal canal, causing hypoglossal nerve paralysis, and petrous carotid canal.

Pub-med,The Masseteric-Facial Anastomosis With Intratemporal Translocation of the Facial Nerve: Step-by-Step Technique and Results,"Background: In the absence of a viable proximal nerve stump, damaged after surgical procedures around the skull base, numerous techniques for facial reanimation have been developed over time, aiming to restore baseline symmetry and active mimicry. Objective: To report experience using the masseteric nerve as a direct transfer to the facial nerve rerouted after intratemporal translocation. This paper illustrates the main steps of the technique and the quality of results. Methods: Eleven patients were treated with a masseteric direct transfer to the facial nerve. Its extratemporal rerouting toward the zygoma allowed tension-free coaptation between donor and recipient nerves. Results: Of the 11 patients, 8 had a good to excellent recovery, showing different patterns of time and scores, according to age, surgical timing, and masseteric nerve function quality. The return of activity in the frontalis muscle, never obtained after reinnervation via the hypoglossal nerve, is of particular interest. The quality of the smile can be improved with re-education and practice but remains under volitional control. A true emotional response is still lacking. Conclusion: The masseteric nerve is an excellent alternative to the hypoglossal nerve and can reinnervate the whole territory of the facial nerve rerouted after intratemporal translocation. The overall results are remarkable, but the low quality of the trigeminal nerve, eventually affected by the first surgery, may be an important limitation. Even if the patients appear more at ease in re-education than with other techniques, a fully natural facial expression remains impossible to obtain.",2,,2,0,10,2,2,1,0,10.1093/ons/opab286,Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown). 2021 Oct 13;21(5):360-370. doi: 10.1093/ons/opab286.,"Ferraresi S, Basso E, Maistrello L, Di Pasquale P.",2021,34424333,neg: lacking true emotional response (smile),8,,,,,Masseteric nerve transfer,,,['Alt flap'],Alt ,,
Pub-med,Facial Reanimation Using Free Functional Muscle Transfer: Lessons Learnt From a Long Term Experience Comparing Innervation With Cross Facial Nerve Graft and Masseter Nerve,"Background: Facial palsy is a complex problem and goal of reanimation is to achieve symmetric face at rest and spontaneous smile. In our study the authors performed facial reanimation in long standing cases of facial palsy (more than 1 year), gracilis muscle was used as a free functioning muscle transfer. Two motor donor nerves were used: cross-face nerve graft and masseter nerve. Materials and methods: A total of 205 cases of unilateral facial reanimation with free functional muscle transfer (FFMT) were performed between 1998 and 2019. Out of 205 patients, 184 patients were operated by cross facial nerve graft-gracilis, and 21 by masseter nerve-gracilis. Quantitative assessment for outcome was done by measuring the excursion on follow up. Oral competence outcome and satisfaction score calculation was done by questionnaire. Results of spontaneous smile were divided into positive and negative groups. Results: A 2 stage cross facial nerve graft-gracilis FFMT achieved most natural and spontaneous smile when longer observation period (‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨¬¢2 years) was followed. Masseter nerve-gracilis provided satisfactory results in the shortest rehabilitation period, had more excursion but never obtained spontaneous smile. Conclusions: The cross facial nerve graft-gracilis FFMT can achieve natural and spontaneous smile and remains our first choice for facial reanimation. Masseter nerve-gracilis can be used if cross facial nerve graft-gracilis fails, patient desires a single stage surgery and in some specific conditions, such as bilateral mobius syndrome.",4,,1,3,0,9,3,1,0,10.1097/SCS.0000000000008606,J Craniofac Surg. 2022 Mar 8. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000008606.

Pub-med,Stabilization and reanimation of the lower lip in facial palsy. Retrospective study about 66 patients and literature review. Proposition of a decision algorithm,"Several techniques for the stabilization and the reanimation of the paralyzed lower lip have been proposed, sometimes combined but the authors are rather vague. Thanks to our cases and a literature review, we suggest an algorithm. Sixty-six patients haven been reviewed. The static and dynamic clinical evaluation have been done thanks to the study of the medical files, photographs and videos samples. The different techniques we have used were: (a) botulinum toxin in the contralateral depressor labii inferioris (DLI) (n=66), contralateral DLI myectomy (n=1); (b) a strip of fascia lata (n=16) either combined with a lengthening temporalis myoplasty (MAT) (n=10) or only realizing a passive suspension thanks to one vector (n=4), or a passive suspension with two strips (n=2); (c) digastric muscle transfer (n=4). When the elevator muscles are sounds, botulin toxin (¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± myectomy) is proposed if the lower lip is not inverted. Otherwise, a suspension thanks to a digastric muscle transfer or a passive suspension with a horizontal and a vertical strips are recommended. If the elevator muscles are no more operational, a MAT with a passive suspension with one vector is considerated and if the lower lip is inverted, a digastric muscle transfer with a fascia lata strip or a MAT with two strips is proposed. This algorithm submission allows to refine the treatment of the stabilization and the reanimation of the lower lip.",0,,2,3,,0,0,0,1,10.1016/j.anplas.2021.09.003,Ann Chir Plast Esthet. 2022 Feb;67(1):20-25. doi: 10.1016/j.anplas.2021.09.003.

Embase,"""Smile"" reconstruction in facial paralysis","Reanimation of the face following facial nerve paralysis, especially the socially important smile, presents a complex surgical challenge requiring an individual approach. Both neural and non-neural operative procedures have been used in an attempt to achieve the goal of a symmetrical synchronous smiling expression. A retrospective review of the results of both neural and non-neural methods was made to determine the relative efficacy of various methods. Of the neural techniques, early direct nerve repair primarily consistently achieved the best functional recovery. Double nerve grafts were found to be superior to a single nerve graft in nerve severance with a nerve gap at the facial nerve trunk bifurcation in delayed cases. In long-standing cases, ipsilateral or cross-face nerve grafting followed by functioning muscle transfer gives the most acceptable synchronous smile. Although cross-face nerve graft only, hypoglossal facial transfer, or non-neural techniques such as temporal muscle transfer achieved restoration of the smile, their inconsistent results and asynchronous action still limited the patient's confidence in social interactions.",6,,0,3,1,2,4,1,0,10.1097/00000637-198907000-00010,Annals of Plastic Surgery (1989) 23:1 (56-65).

All patients previously had undergone resection of a large acoustic neurinoma and the facial nerve had been resected at that time. The interval between tumor reaction and hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis ranged from 1 to 6 months, with an average of 2.1 months. Postoperative recovery of facial movement was good in all cases during an average follow-up period of 4.2 years. In all eight patients, the degree of hypoglossal nerve atrophy on the operated side was graded mild or moderate, but not severe. It was concluded that hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis results in good facial reanimation as long as the procedure is performed early after the onset of facial palsy and that this procedure may reduce the degree of hemiglossal atrophy in comparison with classic hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis.",3,,0,0,9,9,2,1,0,10.3171/jns.1995.82.1.0051,Journal of Neurosurgery (1995) 82:1 (51-54).

Embase,Quantitative facial motion analysis after functional free muscle reanimation procedures,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of functional free muscle transfer in patients with chronic facial paralysis using a recently developed quantitative method known as the maximum static response assay of facial motion. A retrospective review of a single surgeon series of six patients with longstanding facial paralysis was performed. The maximum static response assay was performed on all patients preoperatively and serially during the postoperative period. Twenty-seven patients (54 sides) with normal facial function were also evaluated and served as controls. The contralateral normal side in those patients with unilateral facial paralysis (n = 4) also served as a control. Movement of the modiolus during smile was recorded in the x axis and y axis. To determine net smile movement, the vector of movement was calculated by means of the Pythagorean theorem. Vectors were then defined mathematically by calculating direction and magnitude. The average direction of the vector during smile for the normal control population was 58.3¬¨‚àû(range 32.5 to 83.1¬¨‚àû) from the horizontal through the modioli, and the average magnitude was 10.6 mm (range 4.2 to 20.1 mm). The average preoperative direction for the reanimated sides was 176.8¬¨‚àûwith a range of 83.3 to 225¬¨‚àû. Patients with bilateral paralysis (n = 2) were excluded for calculation of the vectors on the normal contralateral side. The average preoperative direction for the normal contralateral side in patients with facial paralysis was 58.3¬¨‚àûwith a range of 48.2 to 68.4¬¨‚àû. Postoperatively, the average direction of the vector during smile for the reanimated sides improved to a value of 77.6¬¨‚àûwith a range of 45.7 to 113.8¬¨‚àû. The average change in direction of the preoperative reanimated side compared with the postoperative reanimated side was significant (p = 0.01). Postoperatively, the average direction of the vector for the contralateral normal sides was 43¬¨‚àûwith a range of 11 to 57.2¬¨‚àû. The change in direction for the contralateral normal side was not significant (p = 0.18). The average magnitude of the reanimated side improved from a non-anatomic 2.8 mm preoperatively (range 0.8 to 6.8 mm) to an anatomic 4.9 mm postoperatively (p = 0.02). The contralateral normal side magnitude decreased from 9.4 mm (range 7.3 to 11.6 mm) preoperatively to 5.7 mm (range 3.8 to 7.7 mm) postoperatively (p = 0.006). More specifically, the absolute change in movement on the reanimated side during smile for the x axis and y axis was 2.3 mm (p = 0.05) and 4.0 mm (p = 0.002), respectively. This corresponded to an absolute change in the magnitude of the vector of 4.6 mm in an anatomic direction, on the contralateral side the absolute change in magnitude during smile from preoperative to postoperative for the x axis and y axis decreased by 1.5 mm (p = 0.13) and 5.3 mm (p = 0.05), respectively. This reflected an absolute change in the magnitude of the vector of 5.5 mm. Functional free muscle transfer in patients with chronic facial paralysis resulted in anatomic recovery of motion in the majority of patients in this series.

Embase,Facial reanimation with jump interpositional graft hypoglossal facial anastomosis and hypoglossal facial anastomosis: Evolution in management of facial paralysis,"When viable proximal facial nerve is inaccessible, facial nerve paralysis has been classically managed with the hypoglossal facial anastomosis (HFA) for at least the past 70 years. While this procedure has proven its reliability, its problems with hemilingual atrophy (speech deglutition, drooling, mastication), hypertonia, synkinesis, and mimetic deficits indicate the need for a more perfect solution for facial paralysis. The jump interpositional graft hypoglossal facial anastomosis (JIGHFA) along with gold weight lid implantation and electromyographic (EMG) rehabilitation achieves substantial facial reanimation without hemilingual deficits. We present our results in 18 patients who underwent JIGHFA along with gold weight lid implantation and EMG rehabilitation for facial paralysis. These results were compared with those from published series of 30 patients treated with HFA with EMG rehabilitation evaluated with objective (House-Brackmann) criteria. Anonymous retrospective information from questionnaires from 22 of 48 patients who were treated with the classic HFA was also presented. In properly selected patients, the JIGHFA technique is capable of achieving substantial facial reinnervation (House-Brackmann grade III or better) in 83.3% of the patients without hemilingual sequelae which was seen in 45% of the HFA patients. In contrast to the HFA, this procedure can be used by patients with concomitant lower cranial nerve paralysis (except hypoglossal), and bilateral facial paralysis. Hypertonia, synkinesis, and lagophthalmus were less symptomatic in the JIGHFA patients.

Embase,Free split and segmental latissimus dorsi muscle transfer in one stage for facial reanimation,"The authors report the experience in facial reanimation using free innervated split and segmental latissimus dorsi muscle flap one-stage transfer in 86 patients with longstanding facial palsy. The segmental latissimus dorsi was taken from the distal part of the muscle so that the muscle flap had an ultra-long neurovascular pedicle of 13 to 17.5 cm in length. The muscle flap was made thinner by splitting the segmental muscle. The split segmental muscle flap was transferred to the paralyzed side of the face with its ultra-long neurovascular pedicle passing through a tunnel in the upper lip to the normal side of the face. The neurovascular pedicle of the muscle flap was anastomosed with the facial nerve, artery, and veins, respectively, on the normal side of the face. The operation was designed without the cross-facial nerve graft stage. From 1986 to October of 1997, 86 patients with longstanding facial paralysis were treated in our department. The duration of facial palsy in this series ranged from 1.5 to 51 years. A satisfactory result was obtained in 80 cases, evaluated at 8 months to 2 years postoperatively. The expression movement of the soft tissues of the face can be seen not only over transferred muscle but also on the paralyzed muscle covered by the splitting muscle flap.

Embase,Reanimation of the paralyzed face by indirect hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis,"Background: The results of indirect hypoglossal facial nerve anastomosis with interposition of a free nerve graft, end-to-end to the periferal facial nerve stump, and end-to-side to the hypoglossal nerve are prospectively evaluated. This technique is supposed to overcome loss of hypoglossal function. Methods: Tongue function in 39 consecutive patients and facial reanimation in 29 patients who completed 24 months follow-up were assessed. Facial nerve function was judged using the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. Results: Tongue movements were normal in all operated on patients. Initial facial movements occurred on average 7.5 months postoperatively. The results were graded HB II in 6 (20.9%), HB III in 13 (44.6%), HB IV in 7 (24.1%), HB V in 2 (6.8%) patients, and HB VI in 1 (3.4%) patient. The results were significantly better in young patients and when a short time interval between paralysis and surgery existed. Conclusions: Indirect hypoglossal-facial anastomosis is the preferred technique in most patients for whom the classical direct hypoglossofacial anastomosis is indicated. ¬¨¬© 2001 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

Embase,Results and complications of facial reanimation following cerebellopontine angle surgery,"The present study was undertaken to evaluate the results of a group of patients following treatment for cerebellopontine angle lesions who developed postoperative facial palsy and underwent facial nerve repair in order to reanimate the muscles of facial expression. A retrospective study was performed on 23 patients treated between 1988 and 1997 at the 2nd and 4th ENT chairs of University ""La Sapienza"" of Rome for facial palsy following cerebellopontine angle surgery. Tumors included acoustic neuromas (n = 3). Seventeen patients underwent hypoglossal-facial anastomoses [10 with end-to-end anastomoses, 4 with May's interposition ""jump-nerve"" grafts and 3 with partial (30%) use of the hypoglossal nerve plus a facial cross-over]. The remaining patients were operated on using a cable graft with the sural nerve (n = 2) and the great auricular nerve (n = 4). Postoperative facial function was determined by the House-Brackmann 6-scale classification. The hypoglossal-facial anastomoses resulted in long-term grade III or IV findings. Cable grafts improved facial function from grade VI to grade III. None of the patients operated on with the modfied VII-XII anastomosis developed swallowing disturbances. The ten patients having traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomoses showed different degrees of tongue disability and retention of residue in the oral cavity. Surgical recovery of postoperative facial palsy can be obtained with various techniques according to the availability of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem. Since a traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomosis procedure can be a source of a separate disability for the patient, techniques are preferred that leave the hypoglossal nerve mostly intact and uncompromised.",3,,0,2,9,9,2,1,0,10.1007/s004059900211,European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (2001) 258:1 (45-48).

Embase,A modified temporalis transfer in facial reanimation,"A modified surgical procedure for temporalis transfer in facial reanimation of five consecutive cases is presented. Instead of the traditional stripping of the temporalis from its origin, its attachment at the coronoid removed, and to its end, the harvested fascia lata graft was sutured to lengthen the muscles action. These fibres were then passed to the Orbicularis Oculi and Oris to aid in reanimation and to improve their tone. The procedure is less extensive, provides a direct line of pull with good functional results, no muscle atropy since vascularity and innervation is maintained. No complaints of paresthesia, hyposthesia or scar on donor leg was noticed. None of the patients required a revision of surgery for unacceptable contour or asymmetry.

This combined technique provides some benefits such as early facial reanimation resulting from the single-stage procedure, less morbidity and sufficient innervation with an application of the end-to-side anastomosis method, and efficient neural regeneration due to coaptation of the intratemporal facial nerve.

Embase,A comparison of surgical techniques used in dynamic reanimation of the paralyzed face,"Objectives: To compare the outcomes of three surgical techniques used in the rehabilitation of the paralyzed face. Study Design: Retrospective study. Setting: University-based tertiary referral center. Patients: Between 1976 and 2000, rehabilitative facial nerve surgery was performed on 70 adult patients with varying underlying diseases. Intervention: Three methods of facial nerve rehabilitative surgery were performed: end-to-end anastomosis, cable nerve graft interposition, and classic faciohypoglossal transposition. Main Outcome Measures: The House-Brackmann grade was scored at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months by the two senior authors. A favorable outcome was defined as House-Brackmann Grade ‚Äö√¢¬ß III. Other parameters recorded were repair technique, age, nerve rerouting, whether the repair was immediate or delayed, and the anatomic position of the nerve defect in relation to the geniculate ganglion. Results: Data were available on 66 patients (94%), of whom 13 had an end-to-end anastomosis, 25 a cable nerve graft interposition, and 28 a classic faciohypoglossal transposition. At 24 months, a House-Brackmann Grade ‚Äö√¢¬ß III was achieved in 84.6% of those who underwent end-to-end anastomosis, 56.0% of those who underwent cable nerve graft interposition, and 25.0% of those who underwent classical faciohypoglossal transposition. End-to-end anastomosis and cable nerve graft interposition were superior to classic faciohypoglossal transposition (log-rank test, p = 0.0013). Twenty-five percent of all cases demonstrated improvement in House-Brackmann grade after 24 months. Increasing age at the time of repair was associated with a poorer outcome (p = 0.03 on logistic regression). Conclusion: End-to-end anastomosis confers the best facial function, followed by cable nerve graft interposition and then classic faciohypoglossal transposition. Contrary to some previous opinions, improvement in facial function can still occur 2 years after surgical repair, particularly with classic faciohypoglossal transposition. ¬¨¬© 2005, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.",4,,0,0,10,9,2,1,0,10.1097/00129492-200503000-00028,Otology and Neurotology (2005) 26:2 (284-291).

Embase,Temporalis muscle-galea pedicled flap for reconstruction of longstanding facial paralysis,"Reanimation of longstanding facial paralysis is a difficult clinical problem commonly tackled with the method of pedicled muscle flap transfer. The temporalis muscle has been the most popular. In the past one common problem was that the flap was not long enough to reach parts of the face distant from the affected area. To overcome this disadvantage, we have devised a flap consisting of the pedicled temporalis muscle, temporal fascia and galea together and have achieved good static results in paralyzed faces. From June, 1996 to May, 2003, we used this procedure with 38 longstanding facial paralysis patients (16 male and 22 female); 23 had right-sided and 15 had left-sided facial paralysis. The patients were followed-up over three years. Our results were recorded as ""Excellent"", ""Good"", ""Fair"" or ""Poor"". Excellent or good results were obtained in 33 patients (87%). In these patients, the static results are very good. The oral commissure on the affected side maintained a favorable position and almost complete symmetry of expression was attained. We have acheived dynamic reconstruction by using a temporalis muscle-galea pedicled flap in 38 longstanding facial paralysis patients. Our results show that this is a good option in treating such patients.",0,,0,1,0,9,2,1,0,10.1272/jnms.72.105,Journal of Nippon Medical School (2005) 72:2 (105-112).

Embase,Postoperative functional evaluation of different reanimation techniques for facial nerve repair,"Background: The facial nerve function after facial-facial nerve anastomosis, grafting, hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, hypoglossal-facial interpositional jump nerve anastomosis, or a combined approach was analyzed. Methods: Facial function was assessed after operation using a 7-point visual analog scale (VAS) and by electromyography (EMG) in 53 patients. The final result was judged by May's facial nerve grading system. Results: Voluntary EMG activity occurred on average 4.52 ¬¨¬± 1.31 months after operation. Initial facial movements were visible after 5.41 ¬¨¬± 1.80 months. Facial function related to the VAS finally reached 44% of normal value. The result was judged May's grade I in 13%, grade II in 34%, grade III in 28%, and grade IV in 25% of patients. A significant difference in outcome between different reconstruction types was not seen. Age over 60 years was related to worse outcome. Conclusions: A correct selection of the best method in the individual situation presumed, all analyzed facial reanimation techniques seem to lead nearly similar and satisfactory results. ¬¨¬© 2006 Excerpta Medica Inc.

Embase,Modification of tension on muscle insertion improves smile in free-muscle transplantation,A functional free muscle without creation of different vectors and tension adjustment is an insufficient substitute for the mimetic muscles in the reanimation of facial paralysis. Placement of the lower 3 slips of the serratus anterior muscle and their tension adjustment were revised in 2 patients with facial paralysis to provide stronger upper lip movement and coordinated movement of the corner of the mouth superiorly and laterally. The slips were harvested with gradually decreasing lengths and separated from each other on both sides of their common neurovascular pedicle. The 9th slip was oriented at 55 to 60 degrees to the upper lip with the greatest tension. The 8th slip exerted original strength of tension to the modiolus at 45 degrees. The 7th slip was placed horizontally with the least tension. The results were evaluated according to open and closed lip smile and excursion of the modiolus. Stronger upper lip elevation and sufficient elevation of the modiolus with a proper 3-directional movement were demonstrated.

Embase,One-stage reanimation of the paralyzed face using the rectus abdominis neurovascular free flap,"BACKGROUND: Functional free muscle transfer for the surgical correction of long-standing facial paralysis has gained validity over the past three decades. These traditionally multistep reconstructions often achieve clinical success, but at the cost of significant morbidity and lengthy recovery periods. To address this dilemma, the authors propose reconstruction using the rectus abdominis and accompanying intercostal nerve in a one-stage neurovascular free flap reanimation procedure. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, five patients with long-standing unilateral facial paralysis at the University of Pittsburgh Facial Nerve Center underwent reanimation using the authors' protocol. Preoperative and postoperative assessments included clinical evaluation using the Facial Grading System and electromyography. The patients were followed for a mean of 16 months. RESULTS: At the final postoperative visit, all five patients demonstrated improved levator electromyographic potential, with a median 67 percent improvement. All five patients further demonstrated an increase in zygomaticus electromyographic potential, with a median 225 percent improvement. All five patients demonstrated increased Facial Grading System score at most recent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The one-step reanimation using free rectus abdominis neurovascular free flap demonstrated a consistent positive outcome in electromyographic and clinical assessments. The additional benefits of reduced recovery time and anatomical reliability of the flap render the authors' method preferable to other traditional methods of surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face.

Embase,One-stage reconstruction of facial paralysis associated with skin/soft tissue defects using latissimus dorsi compound flap,"Neurovascular free muscle transfer is now the mainstay for smile reconstruction in the treatment of established facial paralysis. Since facial paralysis due to ablative surgery or some specific disease sometimes accompanies defects of the facial skin and soft tissue, simultaneous reconstruction of defective tissues with facial reanimation is required. The present paper reports results for 16 patients who underwent reconstruction by simultaneous soft tissue flap transfer with latissimus dorsi muscle for smile reconstruction of the paralysed face. Soft tissue flaps comprised skin paddle overlying the latissimus dorsi muscle (n=6), serratus anterior musculocutaneous flap (n=5), serratus anterior muscle flap (n=2), and latissimus dorsi perforator-based flap with a small muscle cuff (n=3). The latissimus dorsi muscle can be elevated as a compound flap of various types, and thus offers the best option as a donor muscle for facial reanimation when soft tissue defects require simultaneous reconstruction. ¬¨¬© 2005 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,1,0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2005.10.011,"Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (2006) 59:5 (465-473).

Embase,Nerve sources for facial reanimation with muscle transplant in patients with unilateral facial palsy: Clinical analysis of 3 techniques,"Ninety-one patients with long-standing unilateral facial palsy and submitted to reanimation of the face with muscle transplant were divided into 3 nonrandomized groups: group I: 2-stage facial reanimation, cross face followed by gracilis muscle transplant, 58 patients; group II: 1-stage reanimation with latissimus dorsi muscle transplant, 11 patients (a branch of the facial nerve on the nonparalyzed side of the face was used as the nerve source for reanimation in groups I and II); group III: 1-stage reanimation with gracilis muscle transplant and neural coaptation of the respective nerve and the ipsilateral masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve, 22 patients. No microvascular complications were observed. The average interval between surgery and initial muscle contractions was 11.1 months, 7.2 months, and 3.7 months in group I, group II, and group III, respectively. The quality (intensity and shape) of the smile, voluntary or involuntary, obtained on the reanimated side in relation to the unaffected side was considered good or excellent in 53.4%, 54.5%, and 86.3% of the patients in groups I, II, and III, respectively. In group I, the average age of the patients with excellent or good results (19.8 + 10.5 years) was significantly lower than that of the patients with fair or poor results or absence of movement (36.5 + 13.3 years). The smile was considered emotional or involuntary in 34% of the patients in group I and 45% in group II. Most of the patients in each group were only able to produce ""voluntary smiles"". Crossed synkinesis with lip puckering was observed in 48% of the patients in group I and 90% in group II.

Embase,Uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial paralysis,"BACKGROUND: The superficial temporal fascia merits its popularity in reconstructive surgery for its large number of clinical applications. In this report, the authors present their experience with different uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial reanimation. METHODS: Seventeen cases are presented. In 10 patients, the fascial flap provided a vascularized lining at the interface between the free muscle flap for smile restoration and the overlying skin. In six cases, it was utilized to correct small or moderate contour deficits in the paretic hemiface, using either the fascial flap alone or in combination with free adipose tissue. One patient presented with facial paralysis and Frey syndrome following parotidectomy, and the fascial flap was used to control gustatory sweating. Five independent observers graded aesthetic and functional outcomes on a scale from poor to excellent. Three patients were lost to follow-up, so 14 cases were evaluated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months (47 ¬¨¬± 60.49 months). The specific reconstructive goal for each patient was achieved and the overall symmetry was greatly improved, with all patients being granted higher scores by the panel of observers following the superficial fascia flap (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks, p < 0.0001). Transient or permanent alopecia along the temporal incision was the main complication observed. CONCLUSIONS: Transfer of the superficial temporal fascia flap is a valuable technique with several potential applications in facial paralysis management and reconstructive surgery in general. The advantages of this highly vascularized, gliding, and pliable flap far outweigh the associated minimal complications. ¬¨¬© 2008 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,0,10,9,2,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e31818dc012,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008) 122:6 (176e-185e).

Embase,Use of mini-temporalis transposition to improve free muscle outcomes for smile,"BACKGROUND: In managing late facial paralysis, association of cross-facial nerve grafting and free muscle transfer proves superior to any other method of mid-face reanimation. Nevertheless, predicting functional recovery remains a struggle, and in a minority of patients, results are deceiving. In this study, cases of fair or moderate outcomes from a free muscle transfer received a segmental temporalis transposition to upgrade the functional and aesthetic results. METHODS: From 1981 to 2007, 153 patients received a free muscle transfer for smile restoration in the authors' center. Of all patients, 72 percent (110 patients) required a third stage of revisions. In 41 cases, mini-temporalis transfer was used to augment moderate outcomes of a free muscle transfer. The exclusion criterion was less than 3 months' follow-up; thus, six patients were not evaluated. Each patient was videotaped at three successive time points (preoperatively, following free muscle transfer, and following mini-temporalis transfer). Five independent observers graded patients' videos using a five-category scale from poor to excellent. RESULTS: In all of the patients, the averaged scores were higher after free muscle transfer in comparison with the preoperative scores (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0001). After mini-temporalis transfer, 97.1 percent of the patients had scores that were increased further and 2.8 percent had the same scores. Alopecia along the coronal incision was seen in four patients, and hollowing of the infratemporal fossa was seen in five. CONCLUSION: Analysis of these clinical data supports the use of mini-temporalis transfer as a safe and reliable method of correcting imperfect outcomes following a free muscle transfer for smile restoration. ¬¨¬© 2008 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,1,9,9,2,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e31818a9adc,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008) 122:6 (1723-1732).

Embase,Muscle transplants for facial reanimation: Rationale and results of insertion technique using the palmaris longus tendon,"Thirty-one patients with unilateral long-standing facial palsy underwent 1-stage reanimation with free gracilis muscle transplant innervated by the masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve. They were divided into 2 nonrandomized groups according to insertion technique: group I (9 patients), interrupted suture between the free flap and the orbicularis oris of the upper and lower lip on the paralyzed side; group II (22 patients), palmaris longus tendon graft placed between the gracilis free flap and the orbicularis oris of the upper and lower lip on the nonparalyzed side. Qualitative evaluation of the smile demonstrated better results in patients from group II. Comparing the position of the Cupid's bow at rest, pre- and postoperatively in each patient, we observed significant improvement of facial symmetry in both groups. During smile, however, there was a significantly higher rate of centralization of the Cupid's bow in patients submitted to reanimation with the use of the palmaris longus tendon (group II). ¬¨¬© 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",0,,2,0,10,9,8,3,0,10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181893867,Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009) 63:2 (148-152).

Embase,Single-stage facial reanimation in the surgical treatment of unilateral established facial paralysis,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of unilateral long-standing facial paralysis requires transposition of new musculature to restore the function of the atrophied mimetic musculature. Facial reanimation with free neuromuscular flaps is actually the accepted standard treatment. Two-stage procedures have been used for years, with a total flap recovery time of 18 to 24 months. In 1998, Harii proposed single-stage facial reanimation using the latissimus dorsi flap, showing a faster recovery compared with two-stage procedures. The present study evaluated the results of the authors' center applying the single-stage facial reanimation. METHODS: From April of 1999 to April of 2006, 33 patients with unilateral established facial paralysis underwent single-stage facial reanimation via latissimus dorsi free flap transplantation. Time from the onset of paralysis ranged from 20 months to 64 years (mean, 11.6 years). Patients were followed postoperatively for at least 24 months. Results were studied and compared using Terzis and Noah's 1997 classification. RESULTS: Among the 33 patients included in the study, there was an average reinnervation time of 8.9 months. According to Terzis and Noah's classification system, 12 patients (36.3 percent) were considered grade V, 12 (36.3 percent) were grade IV, four (12.2 percent) were grade III, two (6.1 percent) were grade II, and three (9.1 percent) were grade I. CONCLUSIONS: Single-stage facial reanimation with a latissimus dorsi flap achieved morphofunctional results similar to those obtained with the classic two-stage technique. In addition, the authors were able to reduce the morbidity associated with treatment and the time required for recovery. ¬¨¬© 2009 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,0,9,9,2,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181aa0e2b,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009) 124:1 (124-133).

Embase,Long-term outcomes of free-muscle transfer for smile restoration in adults,"BACKGROUND:: The cross-facial nerve grafting/free-muscle transfer strategy for smile restoration is superior to static reconstruction or regional muscle transposition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this technique in adult patients. METHODS:: Eighty-one adult patients received a free-muscle transfer for midface reanimation in the authors' center. Of this group, the authors identified 24 cases with follow-up of 5 years or longer. Smile symmetry and function were evaluated at three points: preoperatively, early postoperatively, and at long-term follow-up. To better evaluate the effect of time, patients were divided into groups according to the length of follow-up: group A, 5 to 6 years; group B, 7 to 10 years; group C, 11 to 15 years; and group D, more than 15 years. Four independent observers rated each patient's smile using a five-category scale ranging from poor to excellent. Panelists were asked to comment on whether the patient's smile weakened over time. RESULTS:: All patients obtained higher scores at 2 years from free-muscle transfer in comparison with their preoperative rates (p < 0.0001). Late outcomes demonstrated that muscle regeneration continues beyond the initial 2 years, with a further increase of the scores and motor units on electromyography at the late follow-up (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0313). No significance was found when comparing both variables among the four groups, indicating that time does not have a differential effect on muscle function. In 80 percent of the evaluations, the four observers agreed on maintained smile symmetry over time. CONCLUSIONS:: Cross-facial nerve grafting/free-muscle transfer is an effective technique for smile restoration in late facial paralysis. These data indicate maintenance of effective muscle function and progressive improvement with time.

Embase,Facial animation in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes,"Background: Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of varying severity, involves multiple cranial nerves and is characterized predominantly by bilateral or unilateral paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves. The paralysis of the VI and VII cranial nerves leads to a lack of function in the muscles they supply. Facial paralysis often causes bilabial incompetence with speech difficulties, oral incompetence, problems with eating and drinking, including pocketing of food in the cheek and dribbling, as well as severe drooling. Methods: In this study, we report on pediatric patients with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes seen and treated surgically from 2003 to September 2007 at the Operative Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery, Head and Neck Department, University of Parma, Italy. Results: Twelve patients underwent microsurgical reconstruction for restoration of facial movement. The contralateral facial nerve was used as a motor donor nerve in 4 procedures, the motor nerve to the masseter muscle was used in 8 patients, and the gracilis muscle was used in all operations, with a total of 17 free-muscle transplantations. All free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. We observed a significant improvement in drooling, drinking, speech, and facial animation with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Conclusions: The gracilis muscle free transfer is a surgical procedure well tolerated by the young patients and well accepted by their families. We consider it a safe and reliable technique for facial reanimation with good aesthetical and functional results in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes. ¬¨¬© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Embase,"""babysitter"" procedure with concomitant muscle transfer in facial paralysis","BACKGROUND:: The ""babysitter"" procedure combines cross-facial nerve grafting with segmental transfer of the hypoglossal to the affected facial nerve. Introduced by Terzis in 1984, the technique can produce satisfactory to excellent results. In long-lasting paralysis, nonetheless, the babysitter procedure may need to be combined with a muscle(s) flap(s) for outcome upgrading, which was the focus of the present study. METHODS:: Thirty-eight patients had the babysitter procedure over a 20-year period (1984 to 2003). Twenty patients had only the babysitter procedure, whereas 18 needed an additional muscle flap(s) (up to three) to enhance function and cosmesis. These muscles included nine free (gracilis, pectoralis minor) and 20 regional (frontalis, minitemporalis, platysma, digastric) muscles for distinct target needs: eye closure, smile restoration, and lower lip depression. The need for a muscle flap was determined at the initial consultation. All free muscles were transferred at the second-stage of the babysitter procedure, whereas regional muscles were also transposed later. Three independent observers graded the results at two time intervals, preoperatively and 2 years after all operations were completed. RESULTS:: The average postoperative grading scores were significantly higher compared with preoperative scores for eye closure, smile, lower lip depression, and overall aesthetic outcome (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). All patients had upgrading of overall aesthetics and smile, whereas four maintained similar scoring for eye closure and one maintained similar scoring for lip depression. All but two had secondary procedures to further enhance facial symmetry. CONCLUSION:: The babysitter procedure in conjunction with muscle transfers in selected patients with late presentation can provide highly satisfactory results when seeking uncompromising outcome.

Embase,Outcomes of microneurovascular facial reanimation using masseteric innervation in patients with long-standing facial palsy resulting from cured brainstem lesions,"Background: The functions of the human face are not only of esthetic significance but also extend into metaphoric nuances of psychology. The loss of function of one or both facial nerves has a remarkable impact on patients' lives. Objective: To retrospectively analyze the functional outcomes of microneurovascular facial reanimation using masseteric innervation. Methods: Seventeen patients with irreparable facial paralysis resulting from benign lesions involving the facial nuclei (n = 14) or M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome (n = 3) were treated with free muscle flaps for oral commissural reanimation using ipsilateral masseteric innervation and using temporalis muscle transfer for eyelid reanimation. Results were analyzed by the absolute commissural excursion and commissural excursion index and by a patient self-evaluation score. Presence of synkinesis was documented. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean, 26.4 months). Results: Normalization of the commissural excursion index was observed in 8 of 17 patients (47%), an improvement was seen in 7 of 17 (41%), and failure was observed in 2 of 17 (12%). The individual dynamics of absolute commissural excursion and commissural excursion index changes are presented. A natural smiling response was observed in 10 of 17 patients (59%) but not in the remaining 7 (41%). This response reflected the patient's ability to relay the natural emotion of smiling through the masseteric nerve. Patients' self-evaluation scores were a level higher than objective indices. CONCLUSIONS: Innervation of free muscle flaps with the masseteric nerve for oral commissure reanimation might play an important role in patients with lesions of the facial nuclei (as in M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome). Synkinesis persists for long periods after surgery. However, most of the patients learned to express their emotions by overcoming this phenomenon. Despite hypercorrection or inadequate correction, patients evaluated themselves favorably. ¬¨¬© 2010 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",2,,2,1,9,9,8,3,0,10.1227/01.NEU.0000375531.77489.79,Neurosurgery (2010) 67:3 (663-674).

Embase,Facial Animation With Free-Muscle Transfer Innervated by the Masseter Motor Nerve in Unilateral Facial Paralysis,"Purpose: Facial paralysis is a congenital or acquired disorder of varying severity leading to an asymmetric or absent facial expression. It represents an important debilitation from both esthetic and functional points of view. In this article we report our experience with patients treated with gracilis muscle transplantation innervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. We discuss the surgical technique and the functional and esthetic results and evaluate the effectiveness of this donor nerve in providing adequate innervation to the muscle transfer for lower facial reanimation. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with unilateral facial paralysis were seen and surgically treated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy, between 2003 and 2007. In this study we report on 8 cases treated with gracilis muscle transfer reinnervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. Results: In this series all free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. Facial symmetry at rest and while smiling was excellent or good in all patients, and we observed a significant improvement in speech and oral competence. With practice, the majority of patients developed the ability to smile spontaneously and without jaw movement. Conclusions: We consider the masseter motor nerve a powerful and reliable donor nerve, allowing us to obtain a commissure and upper lip movement similar to those of the normal site for amount and direction. This is why we think that there may be a larger role for the masseter motor nerve for innervation of patients with unilateral facial paralysis who would otherwise have been considered candidates for cross-facial nerve graft innervation of the muscle transfer. ¬¨¬© 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",2,,1,3,0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.joms.2009.09.024,Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010) 68:7 (1524-1529).

Embase,Outcomes of direct muscle neurotisation in adult facial paralysis,"Fifty-seven adult patients with facial paralysis, who underwent direct muscle neurotisation, were reviewed and divided into three categories depending on the function that direct neurotisation was aiming to augment. Group 1 included 30 patients who underwent direct neurotisation for eye closure and blink, group 2 consisted of 23 patients for smile augmentation, and group 3 comprised 31 patients for depressor. The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 74 years. Denervation time (Dt) ranged from 8 months to 42 years. Eight patients had partial facial paralysis, and 49 patients had complete facial paralysis. The results were based on the functional and electromyography (EMG) scoring of the neurotised muscles showing an overall EMG mean improvement of 26.56% in eye closure, 34.47% in smile restoration and 32.67% in depressor function by the procedure. Median improvement in all facial functions was one grade (25%) in theTerzis grading systems regarding the respective facial functions. The prerequisites are Dt less than 6 months and a functional contralateral facial nerve. In cases where Dt is more than 27 months and preoperative EMG's are silent, a free or pedicled muscle should be used to substitute the denervated native facial muscle. Promoting expressivity and augmenting facial muscle function using direct muscle neurotisation are important components in facial reanimation. ¬¨¬© 2010 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

Embase,Smile reconstruction through bilateral muscular transplants neurotized by hypoglossal nerves,"Free transplant of gracilis muscle is the criterion-standard technique in dynamic rehabilitation of long-standing facial paralysis in which the facial musculature is atrophied. When the facial nerve is not available because of a bilateral lesion, other sources are the masseteric, hypoglossal, or accessory nerves. Although the use of hypoglossal nerve has been relegated to the background because of the morbidity caused by its loss, there are special situations in which the hypoglossal nerve should be considered the first option as donor motor nerve. The present article discusses the case of a patient with dynamic reanimation of bilateral facial paralysis with free-muscle transfer neurotized to the hypoglossal nerve. End-to-side coaptation of gracilis motor nerve and hypoglossal motor nerve allows neurotization of the transplanted muscle with minimum repercussion in speech or swallowing and can provide an adequate spontaneous smile with time.

Embase,Deep-planes lift associated with free flap surgery for facial reanimation,"Between April 1999 and April 2008, 37 patients with long-standing facial paralysis underwent a one-stage facial reanimation with neuromuscular free flaps: 28 patients (group A) underwent flap transposition only; 9 patients (group B) underwent a deep-planes lift (DPL) composed of the superficial muscoloaponeurotic system + parotid fascia at the time of facial reanimation. The postoperative and final results were compared between groups A and B, following the classification of Terzis and Noah (1997). Before the onset of contraction, only group B patients (100%) showed good or moderate symmetry at rest, while none of the patients of group A had a symmetric face. The respective final results for patients in groups A and B who already showed the onset of flap contraction were excellent in 28.6% and 44.5%, good in 42.9% and 33.3%, moderate in 10.7% and 22.2%, and fair or poor and fair in 17.8% and 0% of patients, respectively. The DPL allows immediate symmetry of the face at rest and contributes to upgrading the final static and dynamic results in facial reanimation with free muscular flaps. ¬¨¬© 2010 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.",0,,2,0,9,9,2,1,0,10.1016/j.jcms.2010.09.003,Journal of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery (2011) 39:7 (475-481).

Embase,Modification of the orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer technique for reanimation of the paralyzed face,"Objective. To report a modification of the temporalis tendon transfer technique used in facial paralysis where dynamic adjacent muscle transfer is determined to be the best treatment option. Study design. Case series with chart review. Setting. Tertiary care teaching hospital. Subjects and Methods. Review of 10 consecutive patients who underwent orthodromic transfer of the temporalis tendon and the attached coronoid process for the treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, measurements of oral commissure elevation with smiling, and grading of preoperative and postoperative patient photographs by objective physician observers. Reporting of complications. Results. Patient satisfaction was high, with a mean score of 7.0 (possible score of 10). Four patients were graded by the observer as excellent to superb. The other 6 patients were rated as having fair to good postoperative results. Movement was identified in every patient and ranged from 2.1 to 9.3 mm, with mean movement of the oral commissure of 5.12 mm. One patient developed a seroma at the site of harvest of the fascia that was drained without further complication. Conclusions. This facial reanimation procedure is a novel modification of the temporalis tendon transfer technique in which the coronoid process is transferred in conjunction with the tendon. This technique is minimally invasive and may result in less variability of the postoperative aesthetic result. The procedure allows orthodromic action of the temporalis muscle, is relatively easy to perform, and eliminates the facial asymmetry typically produced by transfer of the origin of the temporalis muscle. ¬¨¬© American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2011.",0,,0,3,6,9,8,1,0,10.1177/0194599811403895,Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (2011) 145:1 (18-23).

Embase,Masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis for early facial reanimation,"Objective: Early repair of facial nerve paralysis when cortical neural input cannot be provided by the facial nerve nucleus, is generally accomplished anastomozing the extracranial stump of the facial nerve to a motor donor nerve. That is generally the hypoglossus, which carries a variable degree of morbidity. The present work aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the masseteric nerve as donor for early facial reanimation, with the advantage that harvesting is associated with negligible morbidity. Methods: Between October 2007 and August 2009, 7 patients (2 males, 5 women) with unilateral facial paralysis underwent a masseter-facial nerves anastomosis with an interpositional nerve graft of the great auricular nerve. The interval between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean 19.2 months). All patients included in the study had signs of facial mimetic muscle fibrillations on electromyography. The degree of preoperative facial nerve dysfunction was grade VI following the House-Brackmann scale for all patients. Results: At the time of the study, all the patients with a minimum follow-up time of 12 months after the onset of mimetic function had recovered facial animation. Facial muscles showed signs of recovery within 2-9 months, mean 4.8 months, with the restoration of facial symmetry at rest. Facial movements appeared while the patients activated their chewing musculature. Morbidity related to this intervention is only the loss of sensitivity of earlobe and preauricular region. Conclusion: The present technique seems to be a valid alternative to classical hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis because of similar facial nerve recovery and lower morbidity. ¬¨¬© 2011 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.",2,,0,3,9,9,8,3,0,10.1016/j.jcms.2011.03.005,Journal of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery (2012) 40:2 (149-155).

Embase,Validation of the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale for the assessment of smile reanimation surgery in facial paralysis,"Objectives: To evaluate the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale as a tool to assess facial reanimation surgery in facial palsy. Software analysis of digital video data is used to measure facial movements, comparing the affected to the normal side. We present the first use of the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale following facial re-animation surgery. Design: A comparison of the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale against the Nottingham scoring system. Subjects undergoing unilateral surgical smile reanimation procedures were selected. Comparison was made with the Nottingham facial palsy scale and the House-Brackmann Scale pre- and postoperatively. Setting: Patients were recruited in the facial palsy clinic of Canniesburn Plastic Surgery Unit, Glasgow. Participants: Seven consecutive patients were selected who were due to undergo unilateral facial reanimation. Main outcome measures: The difference in pre- and post-surgical facial movement as measured using the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale with this value being compared to that obtained using the Nottingham scoring system. Note was also taken of the correlation with House-Brackmann system and clinical correlation. Results and Conclusions: Statistical analysis indicated a linear relationship between the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale and the Nottingham System. The Pearson correlation test was used to confirm the relationship between the two methods giving a result of -0.587, which indicates significant correlation between the two methods. We conclude that the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale is a standardised objective method of assessing the change in facial movement following smile reanimation surgery. We commend it as a useful tool to objectively assess surgical results in this challenging field. ¬¨¬© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",0,,0,0,0,9,2,1,0,10.1111/j.1749-4486.2012.02484.x,Clinical Otolaryngology (2012) 37:3 (181-187).

Embase,Double innervation in free-flap surgery for long-standing facial paralysis,"Objective: One-stage free-flap facial reanimation may be accomplished by using a gracilis transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve, but this technique does not restore the patient's ability to smile spontaneously. By contrast, the transfer of the latissimus dorsi innervated by the contralateral facial nerve provides the correct nerve stimulus but is limited by variation in the quantity of contraction. The authors propose a new one-stage facial reanimation technique using dual innervation; a gracilis muscle flap is innervated by the masseteric nerve, and supplementary nerve input is provided by a cross-face sural nerve graft anastomosed to the contralateral facial nerve branch. Methods: Between October 2009 and March 2010, four patients affected by long-standing unilateral facial paralysis received gracilis muscle transfers innervated by both the masseteric nerve and the contralateral facial nerve. Results: All patients recovered voluntary and spontaneous smiling abilities. The recovery time to voluntary flap contraction was 3.8 months, and spontaneous flap contraction was achieved within 7.2 months after surgery. According to Terzis and Noah's five-stage classification of reanimation outcomes, two patients had excellent outcomes and two had good outcomes. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, the devised double-innervation technique allows to achieve a good grade of flap contraction as well as emotional smiling ability. A wider number of operated patients are needed to confirm those initial findings. ¬¨¬© 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

Embase,Eyelid reanimation with gold weight implant and tendon sling suspension: Evaluation of excursion and velocity using the FACIAL CLIMA system,"Objective: This study aims to analyse the efficacy of static techniques, namely gold weight implant and tendon sling, in the reanimation of the paralytic eyelid. Upper eyelid rehabilitation in terms of excursion and blinking velocity is performed using the automatic motion capture system, FACIAL CLIMA. Methods: Seventy-four patients underwent a total of 101 procedures including 58 upper eyelid gold weight implants and 43 lower eyelid tendon suspension with 27 patients undergoing both procedures. The presence of lagophtalmos, eye dryness, corneal ulcer, epiphora and lower lid ptosis/ectropion was assessed preoperatively. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare preoperative versus postoperative measurements of upper eyelid excursion and blinking velocity determined with FACIAL CLIMA. Significance was set at p <0.05. Results: FACIAL CLIMA revealed significant improvement of eyelid excursion and velocity of blinking (p < 0.001). Eye dryness improved in 49 patients (90.7%) and corneal ulcer resolved without any further treatment in 12 (85.7%) of those with a gold weight inserted. Implant extrusion was observed in 8.6% of the cases. Of the patients with lower lid tendon suspension, correction of ptosis/ectropion and epiphora was achieved in 93.9% and 91.9% of cases, respectively. In eight patients (18.6%), further surgery was needed to adjust tendon tension. Conclusions: The paralytic upper and lower eyelid can be successfully managed with gold weight implant and tendon suspension. The FACIAL CLIMA system is a reliable method to quantify upper eyelid excursion and blinking velocity and to detect the exact position of the lower eyelid. ¬¨¬© 2012 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

Embase,Hypoglossal-facial-jump-anastomosis without an interposition nerve graft,"Objectives/Hypothesis The hypoglossal-facial-anastomosis is the most often applied procedure for the reanimation of a long lasting peripheral facial nerve paralysis. The use of an interposition graft and its end-to-side anastomosis to the hypoglossal nerve allows the preservation of the tongue function and also requires two anastomosis sites and a free second donor nerve. We describe the modified technique of the hypoglossal-facial-jump-anastomosis without an interposition and present the first results. Study Design Retrospective case study. Methods We performed the facial nerve reconstruction in five patients. The indication for the surgery was a long-standing facial paralysis with preserved portion distal to geniculate ganglion, absent voluntary activity in the needle facial electromyography, and an intact bilateral hypoglossal nerve. Following mastoidectomy, the facial nerve was mobilized in the fallopian canal down to its bifurcation in the parotid gland and cut in its tympanic portion distal to the lesion. Then, a tensionless end-to-side suture to the hypoglossal nerve was performed. The facial function was monitored up to 16 months postoperatively. Results The reconstruction technique succeeded in all patients: The facial function improved within the average time period of 10 months to the House-Brackmann score 3. Conclusion This modified technique of the hypoglossal-facial reanimation is a valid method with good clinical results, especially in cases of a preserved intramastoidal facial nerve.

Embase,Novel use of platysma for oral sphincter substitution or countering excessive pull of a free muscle,"Background The present study demonstrates our experience with a novel use of the Platysma in facial reanimation, as a balancing procedure by counteracting an overactive free muscle transfer, and improving oral continence by re-establishing the oral sphincter mechanism. Material and methods Twelve patients, nine female (75%) and three male (25%), with a mean age of thirty-eight years (range: 2-66) are presented. Of these, in seven patients (58%) who had excessive excursion of the free muscle, the contralateral pedicled platysma was transferred to counteract the excessive pull. Four patients (33%) underwent bilateral platysma transfer for oral sphincter restoration, while one (8%) had ipsilateral platysma transfer. Evaluation of aesthetic and functional results was performed by a panel of three independent observers, and the long term efficacy of the procedure was assessed through a patient questionnaire. Results All patients demonstrated significant upgrading of their oral competence associated with eating, drinking and smiling, as it was confirmed by the behavioural analysis (p < 0.01). Six of the ten patients that were available, responded to the Quality of Life Questionnaire. Five out of six were satisfied with their mouth appearance when they smile and five patients have a regular diet and without drooling. Conclusion A novel use of Platysma transposition is described that can substitute for a paralysed orbicularis oris muscle in restoring oral sphincter function or to counter balance an excessively active free muscle that was previously transferred for smile restoration. This novel Platysma transfer technique is intended to be used as an adjunct to other reanimation procedures. ¬¨¬© 2013 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

Embase,Detection and perceptual impact of side-to-side facial movement asymmetry,"IMPORTANCE In this study,we examined whether specific facialmovements have different time-delay detection thresholds, and to what extent such side-to-side facialmovement asymmetry affects subjective ratings ofmovement naturalness. Ratings of dynamic asymmetry in experimentally manipulated video recordings demonstrate that there are different side-to-side time-delay thresholds for distinct regions of the face, with a strong inverse correlation between naturalness rating and the length-of-time delay. These findings will be helpful for counseling patients with unilateral facial paralysis and guide the design of neural interfaces for facial reanimation. OBJECTIVE To determine the detection threshold of side-to-side facial movement timing asymmetry and measure its effect on perceived movement naturalness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Videos of 5 symmetrical facial movements (eye blink, rapid eyebrow raising, slow eyebrow raising, smiling, and lip depression) were edited to introduce 6 levels of side-to-side timing asymmetry, ranging from 33 to 267 milliseconds. Participants (N = 58) viewed video clips through an online survey service, indicating whether they noticed side-to-side asymmetry and judgingmovement naturalness on a 5-point scale. RESULTS Therewas a significant difference among facialmovements in asymmetry detection threshold. Therewas a strong correlation between naturalness ratings and amount of delay acrossmovements (R = 0.823), with greater asymmetry being judged as progressively less natural. Blinkwas judged as less natural at 33, 67, 100, and 133 milliseconds of side-to-side delay compared with all othermovements (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Side-to-side asymmetry in blink timing is detected sooner and viewed as less natural compared with asymmetry of the eyebrow and lips. At 100 milliseconds of delay, nearly all movements are detected as asymmetric, although blink is judged as the least natural. These findings will help set timing goals for facial pacing technologies treating unilateral paralysis. Copyright ¬¨¬© 2013 American Medical Association.

Embase,Retrospective study of the functional recovery of men compared with that of women with long-term facial paralysis,"Sex is likely to play an important part in reanimation of the face after paralysis, with women being superior in terms of resistance to neural injury and regeneration. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of the sex of the patient on the recovery of facial paralysis after surgical reanimation by comparing the degree of restored movement between men and women with long-standing paralysis that was reanimated by transfer of the hypoglossal nerve or cross-face nerve grafting. Between 1999 and 2010 we operated on 174 patients with facial paralysis. Of these we studied 26 cases (19 women and 7 men) with complete long-standing paralysis reanimated with either cross-face nerve grafting (n = 14) or transfer of the hemihypoglossal nerve (n = 12). The degree of movement restored was recorded in each case. Statistical analysis showed that in cases with long-standing paralysis women had significantly more movement restored than men for both cross-face nerve grafting (p = 0.02) and hypoglossal transposition (p = 0.04). We conclude that, after a neural injury, women tend to maintain the viability of the facial musculature longer than men, which suggests that they are more resistant to both denervation and the development of muscular atrophy. Whether this phenomenon can be explained by neural or muscular processes, or both, warrants further studies. ¬¨¬© 2013 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",4,,0,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.bjoms.2013.04.012,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013) 51:8 (684-688).

Embase,"Facial reanimation by staged, split masseter muscle transfer","BACKGROUND: Facial paralysis of the lower face presents severe functional and aesthetic disturbance to patients. The gamut of facial paralysis correction is diverse and must be tailored to the patient. When nerve repair or free functional muscle transfer is unavailable, regional muscle transfer has become a staple in surgical management of facial paralysis. Previous masseter transfers relied on orbicularis oris attachment, which may be atrophic, adhered, or lengthened. Using fascia lata grafts, we describe the senior author's method of staged, split masseter transfer as a reliable method for reanimating the lower third of the face in appropriate candidates.METHODS: The staged, split masseter muscle transfer is a 3-part repair. The first stage places a hemioral fascia lata graft to act as an anchor reinforcement. The second stage transfers the split masseter muscle, suturing to the fascia lata reinforced oral commissure. The third stage, a reefing procedure, is performed 6 to 10 months later under local anesthesia to reinforce attachments.RESULTS: Six patients underwent the staged, split masseter muscle transfer. Mean age was 43 (15-67) years. Mean time to surgery from onset of deficit was 174 months (3 months to 65 years). All patients had significant improvement over preoperative symptoms. Symmetry was restored in repose. On movement, commissure excursion went from 0 to 6.67 mm in the superolateral vector. Of the 6 patients, 5 required an average of 1.5 outpatient revisions to achieve satisfactory results on average of 4.67 (4-127) months after the final stage.CONCLUSIONS: The staged, split masseter transfer is useful for restoring subtle reanimation in patients presenting with facial paralysis. The staged, split masseter transfer provides bulk and restores both static and dynamic function. We present a case series demonstrating excellent long-term functional results.",0,,2,3,10,9,4,1,0,10.1097/SAP.0b013e31826cb267,Annals of plastic surgery (2014) 73:1 (33-38).

Embase,Differences between sexes in dissociation and spontaneity of smile in facial paralysis reanimation with the masseteric nerve,"Background A patient's sex is likely to play an important role in facial paralysis reanimation, with women being superior in terms of development of brain plasticity after reanimation. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of movement dissociation and spontaneity of men versus women reanimated with gracilis transfer neurotized to the masseteric nerve. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of 27 patients who underwent facial paralysis reanimation with microvascular gracilis transplants neurotized to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Patients were classified by sex, comparing age at surgery, denervation time, and follow-up, as well as the rates of movement dissociation and smile spontaneity. Results After reanimation with gracilis to masseteric nerve, movement dissociation and spontaneity were higher in women during the first year after onset of facial movement (p'='.02 and p'='.01, respectively). Conclusion After reanimation with masseteric nerve, women seem to be able to smile spontaneously and independently from teeth clenching earlier than men. ¬¨¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Embase,Salvage procedures after failed facial reanimation surgery using the masseteric nerve as the motor nerve for free functional gracilis muscle transfer,"IMPORTANCE: Free muscle transfer innervated by a cross-facial nerve graft represents the criterion standard for smile reconstruction in facial paralysis. If primary reconstruction fails, a second muscle transfer is usually needed. Herein, we investigated the possibility of avoiding a second free muscle transfer by in situ coaptation of the gracilis muscle to the masseteric nerve.OBSERVATIONS: We report a series of 3 failed free muscle transfers for facial reanimation among 21 free flap transfers performed for facial reanimation between March 2008 and August 2013. To salvage the muscle, we performed coaptation of the neural pedicle from the cross-facial nerve graft to the masseteric nerve. This method allows for leaving the fixation sutures of the muscle at the oral commissure in place. All patients showed muscle contraction after 3 months and a smile with open mouth after 6 months. No significant difference in the range of commissure excursion was observed between the healthy and operated sides.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recoaptation of the neural pedicle from the cross-facial nerve graft to the masseteric nerve, leaving the muscle transplant in place, is a suitable salvage procedure after unsuccessful reconstruction with a cross-facial nerve graft, avoiding a second free muscle transfer.4.",1,,2,0,6,9,8,3,0,10.1001/jamafacial.2014.163,JAMA facial plastic surgery (2014) 16:5 (359-363).

Embase,Comparative objective and subjective analysis of temporalis tendon and microneurovascular transfer for facial reanimation,"The aim of this study was to compare objectively and subjectively the results after temporalis tendon and microneurovascular transfer for reanimation of the paralysed face. For the objective analysis, measurements of the distances between static and dynamic points in three-dimensional space were performed at rest and during smiling. The patients were assessed subjectively by non-professionals scoring videotapes. The range of motion of the oral commissure on smiling was 1.7 mm (0.8, mean and SE) after tendon and 5.5 mm (1.6) after microneurovascular transfer (P < 0.05) without showing teeth, and 0.6 mm (1.3) vs 3.6 mm (2.4, ns) with showing teeth. Compared with the healthy side, the excursions reached 6% (16) after tendon and 71% (26, P < 0.05) after microneurovascular transfer for smiling without, and -4% (14) vs 19% (14, ns) for smiling with showing teeth, respectively. Virtually no difference was found in the measurements at rest as well as in the subjective evaluation. Swelling of the cheek (28%) and tethering of the skin (24%) were shown to be the most disturbing symptoms after microneurovascular transfer. Better excursion and symmetry of the oral commissure were achieved by microneurovascular reconstruction for voluntary smile. However, the aesthetic outcome after microneurovascular transfer is markedly impaired by chronic complications including swelling of the cheek and tethering of the skin, which were not detected by the three-dimensional measurement technique used. We conclude that the aesthetic appearance should be considered equally important as the range of motion in the reanimated face.",0,,0,1,9,2,8,3,0,10.1054/bjps.1997.3060,British Journal of Plastic Surgery (1999) 52:3 (167-172).

Embase,Complications of static facial suspensions with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE),"Background: Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is a synthetic porous material that has been used for static suspension in facial paralysis. It is manufactured in thin (1-mm or 2-mm) sheets that can be cut into strips and implanted through keyhole facial incisions. Regional deformities are addressed by multiple suspensions that provide cosmetic and functional therapy. The use of ePTFE eliminates donor site morbidity associated with the traditional harvest of fascia from either the temporal area or fascia lata. However, properties unique to this alloplast contribute to the complications that have occurred after its use in facial reanimation. Objective: To describe complications with the use of ePTFE for facial suspension. Setting: Academic medical center. Method: Retrospective chart review and review of literature. Results: Six patients with facial paralysis who were treated with the EPTFE sling procedure had complications. Five slings failed because of stretch despite prestretching at implantation. One patient developed a late wound infection requiring removal of the sling. Conclusion: An ePTFE facial sling is an option for static facial suspension that can be therapeutic for patients with seventh nerve damage. There is a high rate of complications leading to revision surgery.

Embase,Cross-facial nerve grafting as an adjunct to hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover in reanimation of early facial paralysis: Clinical and electrophysiological evaluation,"Reanimation of a spontaneous and synchronous smile, and sufficient depressor mechanism of the lower lip presents a surgical challenge in facial paralysis. Hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover and cross-facial nerve grafting are the best options if the mimetic muscles around the mouth are still viable in patients in whom the facial nerve was sacrificed at the brainstem. Although good muscle tone and facial motion have been obtained by hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover, smile is dependent on conscious tongue movement. Cross-facial nerve grafting provides a voluntary and emotion-driven smile, but requires two coaptation sites, which leads to substantial axonal loss and a long regeneration time. This method was not successful in activating the depressor mechanism. The first stage is the classic ""baby-sitting"" procedure, in which the bulk of the mimetic muscles was maintained by the rapid reinnervation of the hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover during the regeneration period of the cross-facial nerve graft, and temporalis muscle transfer to the eyelids is performed. During the second stage, the cross-facial nerve graft that used the thickest zygomaticobuccal branch on the healthy side was coapted with the corresponding branches on the paralyzed side. The hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover continued to innervate the depressor muscles. Good spontaneous smile and sufficient depressor mechanism were achieved by cross-facial nerve grafting and hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover respectively, and these techniques are demonstrated by the authors clinically and electrophysiologically.",6,Hypoglossal + CFNG ,0,3,9,9,8,3,0,10.1097/00000637-200103000-00017,Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001) 46:3 (301-307).

Embase,Evaluation of a new measurement tool for facial paralysis reconstruction,"Evaluation of facial movement, including distance and direction, is essential for anyone interested in facial paralysis reconstruction. The authors' goal was to develop a measurement system that is simple, uses commercially available equipment, takes little time, and provides meaningful and accurate measurements. This technique is called the facial reanimation measurement system. It involves placing dots around the patient's mouth and video recording the patient performing maximal effort smiles. Using a video editing program, one frame showing the patient at rest is overlaid with a second frame showing the patient's smile. This overlaid image is imported into Adobe PhotoShop, where measurements are obtained using tools available in the program. Twenty patients were used to test interrater and intrarater reliability of the facial reanimation measurement system. The accuracy of the measurement process was tested by comparing 10 known distances and angles with those obtained using the facial reanimation measurement system. Both intrarater and interrater reliability of the distance and angle measurements are highly accurate, with intraclass correlations greater than 0.9. The facial reanimation measurement system is accurate to within 0.6 mm and 2.0 degrees when compared with a ""known"" distance and angle. The facial reanimation measurement system has been used to measure smile movements of more than 200 patients and has been demonstrated to be valuable for detecting changes of facial movements over time. This system is simple and economical and only requires 20 minutes to perform.

Embase,Selective marginal mandibular neurectomy for treatment of the marginal mandibular lip deformity in patients with chronic unilateral facial palsies,"Background: For unilateral facial palsies, reanimation techniques such as cross-facial nerve grafting with free muscle transfer have been very successful at improving symmetrical lip elevation when smiling. However, these procedures do not address the residual asymmetry with respect to lip depression resulting from an uncorrected marginal mandibular nerve palsy. Techniques that do address this residual lip asymmetry have had variable results. Selective neurectomy of the unaffected marginal mandibular nerve has largely been abandoned as a treatment since it has been reported to result in severe oral functional and cosmetic deficiencies. The authors argue that selective marginal mandibular neurectomy is a reliable technique for treatment of the marginal mandibular lip deformity that does not compromise oral functionality. Methods: Thirteen patients with unilateral facial palsies underwent selective marginal mandibular neurectomy of the unaffected side; the procedure was performed by the principal investigator. These patients were then evaluated on the basis of symmetry with smiling and oral functionality. Twelve of the patients were contacted and questioned with a standardized questionnaire. Twelve of the patients were evaluated independently for symmetry with smiling using randomized preoperative and postoperative photographs. Results: Eleven of the 12 patients reported either improvement or no change in oral competence. Ten of the 12 patients reported either improvement or great improvement in symmetry with smiling. Improvement in symmetry with smiling was independently observed 77.2 percent of the time. Conclusion: These results support selective marginal mandibular neurectomy of the unaffected side in patients with unilateral facial palsies as a means of improving symmetry with smiling without compromising functionality.",0,,0,0,9,9,8,1,0,10.1097/01.prs.0000182219.40800.56,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005) 116:5 (1223-1232).

Six patients had impairment of brachial plexus, but both sensory and motor disturbance disappeared about 11 months postoperatively. All symptoms had completely vanished by 18.5 months.

Seven months later the first signs of reinnervation of the facial muscles were noticed. Two and a half years after surgery, CN VII function was assessed as grade II/III according to the House-Brackmann scale.

Embase,Tension adjusted multivectorial static suspension with plantaris tendon in facial paralysis,"Facial paralysis in the midface causes loss of cheek tonus, asymmetry at rest, and inability to smile. Static suspension is generally performed in patients who cannot tolerate time-consuming dynamic reanimation. Current methods for static slings are overly simplistic. A sling, which is generally fascia lata or palmaris tendon, is placed between the modiolus and the zygomatic arch or the temporalis fascia, with further extension to the midline of the upper end lower lips in 1 vector. Recently, sutures are placed in a multivectorial approach, but suture failure via breakage is the main problem. In this study, the long, thin, and powerful plantaris tendon was used and divided into 3 slips. Placement of these slips and their tension adjustment were revised to provide strong and long-lasting upper lip and the modiolus pull, along with creation of a well-defined nasolabial fold, and to create sufficient cheek tonus. The first slip was positioned at 35 to 45 degrees to the horizontal plane between the modiolus and the upper preauricular area, second slip at 55 to 60 degrees between the upper lip and the deep temporal fascia, and the third slip at 0 to 10 degrees between the lower lip and lower preauricular area with gradually decreasing tension from above to below in 9 patients.

Embase,Reconstruction of facial nerve after radical parotidectomy,"Conclusion: Most patients benefitted from immediate facial nerve grafting after radical parotidectomy. Even weak movement is valuable and can be augmented with secondary static operations. Post-operative radiotherapy does not seem to affect the final outcome of facial function. Objectives: During radical parotidectomy, the sacrifice of the facial nerve results in severe disfigurement of the face. Data on the principles and outcome of facial nerve reconstruction and reanimation after radical parotidectomy are limited and no consensus exists on the best practice. Method: This study retrospectively reviewed all patients having undergone radical parotidectomy and immediate facial nerve reconstruction with a free, non-vascularized nerve graft at the Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland during the years 1990-2010. There were 31 patients (18 male; mean age = 54.7 years; range = 30-82) and 23 of them had a sufficient follow-up time. Results: Facial nerve function recovery was seen in 18 (78%) of the 23 patients with a minimum of 2-year follow-up and adequate reporting available. Only slight facial movement was observed in five (22%), moderate or good movement in nine (39%), and excellent movement in four (17%) patients.

Embase,Pre-operative masseter muscle EMG activation during smile predicts synchronicity of smile development in facial palsy patients undergoing reanimation with the masseter nerve: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Synchronicity of the oral commissure movement of a bilateral smile is a significant goal for reconstruction in facial reanimation and may only be guaranteed with use of the facial nerve as a donor nerve. Yet over the years several studies report some degree of spontaneity in certain patients when using a non-facial donor nerve, which indicates that synchronous initiation of the smile might be achievable with other donor nerves. We designed a prospective cohort study to evaluate whether pre-operative involuntary activation of the masseteric nerve during smile predicts development of a synchronous smile development when using the masseteric nerve for reanimation. Methods: In a prospective cohort study unilateral long-standing facial palsy patients scheduled for dynamic smile reanimation with a free functional muscle transplant using the masseteric nerve as a donor nerve were preoperatively evaluated via EMG for involuntary activation of the masseter muscle upon smiling, which we called coactivation. Postoperatively, six months after noting the first muscle contraction smile synchronicity was evaluated. We analyzed the synchronicity of the bilateral smile development by analyzing slow-motion video sequences of the patients that were taken while the patients were watching funny video sequences. Results were then correlated with the pre-operative EMG. Results: 30 patients were recruited for this prospective study and underwent facial reanimation surgery with a free gracilis transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve. 19 patients demonstrated involuntary coactivation of the masseter muscle upon smiling and 11 did not. Postoperatively all patients could demonstrate a voluntary smile. 94% of patients who had preoperative coactivation showed a synchronous movement of the oral commissure when smiling. In those patients, that did not show activation of the masseter muscle upon smiling 0% showed synchronicity. The preoperative coactivation of the masseter muscle is able to predict the outcome regarding synchronicity of the smile with a sensitivity of 99.7%, a specificity of 88.5% and 92.5% positive predictive value and 99.6% negative predictive value (p < 0.001 for all).

Embase,Facial reanimation by cross-facial nerve grafting: Report of five cases,"Facial nerve repair is a dynamic reanimation technique. Direct nerve repair by suturing or grafting can provide good results within a specific time frame. Immediate nerve repair has been successful in cases of laceration injuries, but nerve grafting techniques are typically delayed when it is clear that direct suturing to the nerve trunk cannot be achieved without tension. Delayed nerve grafting is also employed following ablative procedures and in cases of trauma that cause segmental nerve deficits. Cross-facial nerve grafting is particularly useful when the peripheral branches are intact and the main trunk of the facial nerve is inaccessible. This method is also typically performed in a delayed fashion. Rehabilitation of the facial nerve and subsequent reinnervation of the mimetic motor endplates are achieved through axonal growth. In this article, we describe a consecutive series of five patients who developed facial paralysis following cranial surgery for acoustic neuroma. Each underwent successful cross-facial nerve grafting during the first week following their initial surgery. Each received a sural nerve graft to at least two main divisions of the VII(th) cranial nerve.

Embase,Long-term results of microvascular free-tissue transfer reanimation of the paralyzed face: Three cases,"We conducted a retrospective case review at our tertiary care academic medical center to assess the long-term results of microvascular free-tissue transfer to achieve facial reanimation in 3 patients. These patients had undergone wide-field parotidectomy with facial nerve resection. Upper facial reanimation was accomplished with a proximal facial nerve-sural nerve graft, and lower facial movement was achieved through proximal facial nerve-long thoracic (serratus muscle) nerve anastomosis. Outcomes were determined by grading postoperative facial nerve function according to the House-Brackmann system. All 3 patients were able to close their eyes independent of lower facial movement, and all 3 had achieved House-Brackmann grade III function. We conclude that reanimating the paralyzed face with microvascular free-tissue transfer provides anatomic coverage and mimetic function after wide-field parotidectomy. Synkinesis is reduced by separating upper- and lower-division reanimation.

Pub-med,Preliminary observations after facial rehabilitation with the ansa hypoglossi pedicle transfer,"Facial paralysis is a very disabling condition, both functionally and cosmetically. Despite the different methods of facial reanimation that have been described, there is no single method that will restore normal facial tone and motion. Of the methods available, primary neurorrhaphy is probably the most effective. The recovery period, however, is prolonged and, as a result, muscle tone and bulk may be lost. The hypoglossal-facial anastomosis is also a very reliable and effective technique but requires necessary interruption of both major cranial nerve trunks. Transfer of a neuromuscular pedicle (based on the ansa hypoglossi) has been offered as a method of facial reanimation that involves neither prolonged recovery nor interruption of the major cranial nerve functions. The application of this technique for reinnervation of a paralyzed larynx was first described by Tucker in 1970, and the technique was applied to facial muscle (in animal models) in 1977. The effectiveness of this technique--and its application in the management of facial paralysis in the human patient--remains controversial. We report our experience with a series of six patients who underwent neuromuscular pedicle transfer in conjunction with other more conventional methods of facial reanimation. The function of the pedicle and its contribution to the overall facial rehabilitation were assessed clinically and electromyographically. Factors influencing the success of the procedure and clinical and experimental evidence to support its application are discussed. While our experience with this technique is limited, it would appear that the neuromuscular pedicle transfer may play a useful adjunctive role in reanimation of the face in selective cases of facial paralysis.",3,,0,0,0,9,8,3,0,10.1177/019459988609400307,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1986 Mar;94(3):302-5. doi: 10.1177/019459988609400307.,"Anonsen CK, Duckert LG, Cummings CW.",1986,3083357,"Tools: EMG, clinical evaluation Outcomes: evidence of reinnervation, facial movements",6,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,

The techniques were evaluated using a standard rating scheme for judging success of reanimation procedures. The combination of a masseter muscle transfer to the lower region of the face and a cable graft of the upper facial nerve division appeared to offer excellent results in terms of independent motion of the upper and lower regions of the face and good eye closure, while allowing spontaneous mimetic function in 50% of cases.

When the cornea is covered during blinking and sleeping, function has been restored, while a pleasing cosmetic result has been achieved if the eyes appear symmetrical when the lids are open. Several procedures have been developed to restore closure of the paralyzed upper eyelid (implantation of gold weights or open wire springs) or to correct lower lid lagophthalmos and ectropion (lower lid tightening with a Bick procedure or insertion of a closed eyelid spring). In some cases, even a combination of the Bick procedure and insertion of a spring may be insufficient to correct lower lid droop; therefore, we developed a technique to place cartilage into the lower eyelid to correct lid droop.

Direct VII-VII neuroanastomosis is superior to any other neuroanastomosis for facial reanimation. Rerouting of the seventh nerve from the mastoid and neuroanastomosis can be accomplished primarily at the initial surgery. This study reviews 19 patients with a follow-up of greater than 18 months who underwent the procedure at the time of tumor removal because of seventh nerve involvement by tumor, intentional sacrifice or, rarely, unintentional division. A House class IV result or better, without the twelfth nerve neurological deficit produced by a VII-XII neuroanastomosis, was achieved in 16 of 19 patients.

The procedure is not an option in patients with bilateral facial paralysis or those at risk for combined cranial nerve deficits. To address some of the drawbacks and limitations of this classic procedure, we developed the hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional jump graft (12-7 jump graft) procedure. This procedure involves interposing a nerve graft between a partially severed but functionally intact twelfth cranial nerve and the degenerated seventh cranial nerve, and is often combined with other reanimation procedures.

Analysis of the results showed this procedure to be highly successful and the method of choice, alone in cases of long-standing facial paralysis or to augment the effects of facial nerve grafting or hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, in reanimating the mouth. It was successful in restoring a smile to 80% of the 219 patients and provided overall improvement in mouth function in 96%. Complications occurred in 21% of patients, with the most common being infection (12% of patients). Since one of us began to use the procedure to reanimate the eye and mouth, results of temporalis muscle transposition have been improved by the following: (1) using the procedure to reanimate the mouth only; (2) performing revision surgery, most often tightening the corner of the mouth (25% of patients), as indicated; (3) transposing only the midsection of the muscle; (4) implanting a prefabricated Silastic prosthesis to fill the muscle defect; (5) when indicated, lengthening the muscle with polytef (Gore-Tex+); and (6) placing the muscle in a tunnel lateral to the superficial musculoaponeurotic system to avoid injuring the underlying facial nerve should some spontaneous recovery of facial nerve function be possible.",3,,0,1,9,9,2,1,0,10.1001/archotol.1993.01880160022004,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1993 Apr;119(4):378-82; discussion 383-4. doi: 10.1001/archotol.1993.01880160022004.,"May M, Drucker C.",1993,8457301,"Neg: infection, hematoma, extrusion of implant, extrusion of suture, seroma, wound dehiscence",219,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,"Indication, technique and results of facial nerve reconstruction","160 patients with various intra- or extracranial pathologies were treated by microsurgical facial nerve reconstruction at Nordstadt Neurosurgical Clinic between 1978 and 1993. Facial nerve reconstruction was accomplished along the anatomical course of the facial nerve from its origin at the brainstem, within the mastoid, at the stylomastoid foramen and within the face. Mostly, reconstruction was indicated because of nerve discontinuity (n = 61), whereas facial nerve reanimation with a donor nerve such as the contralateral facial nerve or the ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve was indicated in 99 cases of loss of a proximal nerve stump. Depending on the site of the lesion reinnervation started at 5 to 15 months postoperatively lasting for 2 to 3 years with overall satisfactory results. 69% of all the patients regained good symmetry on rest, complete eye closure equivalent to House-Brackmann-Score III: Patients with complete failures either suffered of non-related diseases such as cancer leading to death before the estimated time of recovery or were exposed to radiation or received facial nerve reconstruction after long-standing facial deficit and marked muscular atrophy. The indication of the adequate method depends on the clinical course with or without preexisting facial paresis, on considering the intraoperative state of the facial nerve. the identification and microsurgical preparation of adequate nerve stumps, as well as on the adaptation techniques and the postoperative guidance of the patient.

Combination of the facial-hypoglossal anastomosis with simultaneous myoplasty and with anastomosis of the distal hypoglossal nerve stump to the ansa cervicalis provides the advantage of immediate protection against ophthalmic complications, prevents hemiatrophy of the tongue and gives good functional results when reinnervation of the facial muscles takes place.",0,,0,0,0,9,8,3,0,10.3109/02688699409029621,Br J Neurosurg. 1994;8(3):327-32. doi: 10.3109/02688699409029621.,"Kukwa A, Marchel A, Pietniczka M, Rakowicz M, Krajewski R.",1994,7946022,"Tools:Clinical examintion, EMG Outcomes: facial nerve function, first contraction, tongue movements, swallowing, chewing",23,5,11,"Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,anastomosis,ansa cervicalis",,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Determination of palpebral closure using a Hall sensor magnet pair,"A small device that can detect eyelid closure was designed using a Hall sensor and magnet. The ability of the sensor to differentiate blinks from saccadic motion is of vital interest in development of a device to alleviate complications of facial nerve paralysis. Twelve physically normal human subjects were used in this study. A small Hall sensor (3 x 2.5 x 1.1 mm), a device that detects magnetic fields, was attached to the lower eyelid near the lid margin, and an opposing small magnet (3 x 2 x 1 mm) was attached to the upper eyelid, also near the lid margin. Output potentials from the Hall sensor were monitored during eye blinks and saccadic eye movements to correlate sensor potentials with eye movements. Results indicate that the Hall sensor is effective at determining palpebral closure and discriminating eye closure from other eye movements. Therefore, we conclude that the Hall sensor is a reliable means for determining palpebral closure and is ideally suited for use in a facial prosthesis that uses the normal blink as a trigger to reanimate the contralateral paralyzed eyelid.",0,,0,0,0,9,7,2,0,10.1177/019459989411000206,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1994 Feb;110(2):174-6. doi: 10.1177/019459989411000206.,"Hamiel SR, Tubach MR, Bleicher JN, Cronan JC.",1994,8108152,"Tools:Hall sensor Outcomes: output potentials, corrlation between eyelid movements and potentials, palpebral closure",12,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Analysis of the prognosis and the recovery process of profound facial nerve paralysis secondary to acoustic neuroma resection,"The prognosis and the recovery process of facial nerve paralysis were reviewed in 74 patients who, despite preservation of nerve continuity, showed no facial movement after acoustic neuroma resection. In 50 or 67.6% of patients, facial movement recovered sufficiently so as not to require any reanimation procedures. However, no apparent sign of remission was observed for 7-49 months in the other 24 patients (32.4%), and hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis was performed in 20 of these patients. When remission was seen, the first sign of muscle movement appeared most frequently after 3-4 months but, in a small number of patients, it was also seen within 1.5 months or after 5-10 months. Based upon these results, the timing of reanimation procedures for facial nerve paralysis following acoustic neuroma resection is discussed.",0,,0,0,10,5,2,1,0,10.1159/000276686,ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec. 1994 Nov-Dec;56(6):331-3. doi: 10.1159/000276686.,"Kunihiro T, Kanzaki J, Yoshihara S, Satoh Y.",1994,7838485,Tools: Yanagihara grading scale Positive Outcomes: infrequent delayed recovery Negative Outcomes: remission,74,3,4,"Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,anastomosis",,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

Pub-med,Irreversible muscle contracture after functioning free muscle transplantation using the ipsilateral facial nerve for reinnervation,"Four patients who underwent functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) for facial reconstruction developed a progressive disfiguring muscle contracture. This complication has not been previously reported. Three of the patients had longstanding facial paralysis and were reanimated by FFMT. The fourth patient had left hemifacial atrophy but without facial paralysis. She also underwent FFMT for augmentation. All four FFMTs were innervated by the ipsilateral facial nerve. Initially, they all had a normal facial appearance at rest during the first few months after FFMT. However, they all developed a progressive severe muscle contracture from 6 to 12 months after FFMT. Continuous spontaneous electrical impulse activity, which stimulated the transferred muscle day and night, may be responsible for the progressive muscle contracture. From the patients' reported sensations and from clinical evaluation, which included a local xylocaine injection test, over-reinnervation with a synkinesis effect of the transferred muscle is hypothetically the main cause, not over-tension of the muscle itself. This complication may possibly be avoided by limiting or decreasing the number of fascicles from the ipsilateral facial nerve or better by using a cross-facial nerve graft instead of the ipsilateral facial nerve as the innervating motor nerve. The outcome with a cross-facial nerve is likely to be more predictable and reliable.",1,,0,0,1,7,4,1,0,10.1016/0007-1226(95)90021-7,Br J Plast Surg. 1995 Jan;48(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/0007-1226(95)90021-7.,"Chuang DC, Devaraj VS, Wei FC.",1995,7719600,,4,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,

Measurements of integrated electrical activity were made to allow comparison of different muscle groups during active, active-against-resistance, and passive movements. A contraction reflex was assessed by an electromechanical device and noted in 8 of 11 subjects. Lower facial movements were found to involve simultaneous bilateral activity in all the muscle groups tested bilaterally and to require a balance between dilator and constrictor forces. The significance for facial reanimation surgery is that it is desirable to reconstruct balanced constrictor and dilator forces, the latter having vector pulls upwards, downwards and laterally to reconstruct the normal mechanism of lower facial movement.",0,,0,0,0,5,6,2,0,10.1016/s0007-1226(96)90155-1,Br J Plast Surg. 1996 Jul;49(5):274-80. doi: 10.1016/s0007-1226(96)90155-1.,"Cacou C, Greenfield BE, Hunt NP, McGrouther DA.",1996,8774240,"Tools: EMG Outcomes:relative electrical activity, contraction reflex duration",11,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,A new technique for hypoglossal-facial nerve repair,"Hypoglossal reinnervation of the facial nerve may be required after a proximal facial nerve injury. The classic hypoglossal-facial graft procedure involves transection of the donor hypoglossal nerve, resulting in hemiglottic paralysis that, in association with paralysis of other cranial nerves, may cause speech and swallowing difficulties. Multiple lower cranial nerve palsies in conjunction with facial paralysis, as may occur after procedures such as skull base surgery, contraindicate the use of such techniques. The successful use of XII-VII 'interposition jump grafts' without hemiglossal weakness has been described. However, a prolonged recovery period and weaker facial reanimation have been seen. In order to attain maximum facial reinnervation while preserving hypoglossal function, we have developed a new technique of XII-VII repair. This method involves mobilization of the intratemporal portion of the facial nerve remnant, achieving a single anastomosis with the hypoglossal nerve, which has been partially incised. This technique has been used in three patients to date, with 6 to 11 months follow-up. In all cases facial tone and symmetry have been restored and voluntary facial expression accomplished. The authors conclude that by employing the techniques described highly satisfactory cosmetic and functional results may be expected, without compromising hypoglossal nerve function.",3,,0,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1097/00005537-199707000-00028,Laryngoscope (1997) 107:7 (984-991).

Pub-med,Reanimation of the paralyzed face with new gold weight implants and Goretex soft-tissue patches,"Although dynamic reconstruction procedures are preferred for treating patients with complete facial paralyses, static procedures are useful for various conditions. One such technique involves the implantation of gold weights into the upper eyelid. We have reported our experiences with 58 patients who underwent gold weight implantation for rehabilitation of eyelid closure with satisfactory results. To obtain better cosmetic results we developed newly shaped thinner weights. Four instead of three perforations in each weight enable better fixation to soft tissue. Since 40% of all cases also required additional surgery to rehabilitate other portion of the face, polytetrafluoroethylene (Goretex) soft-tissue patches were used for suspension to help correct miDFacial and perioral asymmetry.

Pub-med,Hypoglossal-facial nerve side-to-end anastomosis for preservation of hypoglossal function: results of delayed treatment with a new technique,"This report describes a new surgical technique to improve the results of conventional hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis that does not necessitate the use of nerve grafts or hemihypoglossal nerve splitting. Using this technique, the mastoid process is partially resected to open the stylomastoid foramen and the descending portion of the facial nerve in the mastoid cavity is exposed by drilling to the level of the external genu and then sectioning its most proximal portion. The hypoglossal nerve beneath the internal jugular vein is exposed at the level of the axis and dissected as proximally as possible. One-half of the hypoglossal nerve is transected: use of less than one-half of the hypoglossal nerve is adequate for approximation to the distal stump of the atrophic facial nerve. The nerve endings, the proximally cut end of the hypoglossal nerve, and the distal stump of the facial nerve are approximated and anastomosed without tension. This technique was used in four patients with long-standing facial paralysis (greater than 24 months), and it provided satisfactory facial reanimation, with no evidence of hemitongue atrophy or dysfunction. Because it completely preserves glossal function, the hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis described here constitutes a successful approach in patients with long-standing facial paralysis who do not wish to have tongue function compromised.",3,,0,0,0,7,4,1,0,10.3171/jns.1997.86.2.0203,J Neurosurg. 1997 Feb;86(2):203-6. doi: 10.3171/jns.1997.86.2.0203.,"Sawamura Y, Abe H.",1997,9010420,May's grading system,4,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,anastomosis",,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,One-stage transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle for reanimation of a paralyzed face: A new alternative,"The two-stage method combining neurovascular free-muscle transfer with cross-face nerve grafting is now a widely accepted procedure for dynamic smile reconstruction in cases with long established unilateral facial paralysis. Although the results are promising, the two operations, about 1 year apart, exert an economic burden on the patients and require a lengthy period before obtaining results. Sequelae such as hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and conspicuous scar on the donor leg for harvesting a sural nerve graft also cannot be disregarded. To overcome such drawbacks of the two-stage method, we report a refined technique utilizing one-stage microvascular free transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle. Its thoracodorsal nerve is crossed through the upper lip and sutured to the contralateral intact facial nerve branches. Reinnervation of the transferred muscle is established at a mean of 7 months postoperatively, which is faster than that of the two-stage method.

Pub-med,The gracilis free flap revisited: a review of 25 cases of transfer to traumatic extremity wounds,"Trauma to the extremities often results in a complex bony and soft-tissue injury requiring free flap reconstruction. Muscles from various body sites have been used in extremity reconstruction since the early 1970s. The gracilis muscle is usually not considered the first choice for free flap reconstruction of these defects. It is usually relegated to small defects or used to reanimate the face. Our purpose is to present our experience with the gracilis muscle as a first-choice flap in reconstruction of traumatic extremity defects. A retrospective review of all gracilis muscle free flap transfers for traumatic extremity wounds between 1988 and 1995 at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth was performed. Twenty-five patients age 20 to 71 years (mean, 29.7 years) underwent 26 free flaps to the lower leg, ankle, foot, or forearm to cover traumatic wounds. Defects ranged in size from 3 x 3 cm (9 cm2) to 13 x 18 cm (234 cm2), with a mean of 75.5 cm2. There were no flap losses and all wounds healed. Nine patients experienced 11 complications, which consisted of minor wound separation (16%), wound infection (12%), partial or complete loss of split-thickness skin graft (8%), thrombosis of graft with successful revascularization (4%), and nonunion of an underlying fracture (4%). Our overall success rate for gracilis free flap reconstruction of traumatic wounds is 100%. The gracilis free muscle flap has become our first option for tissue coverage in traumatized extremities. It leaves minimal functional defect limited to the side of the primary injury and provides a good cosmetic result. It can cover large defects when the epimysium is cut, and allows an epidural block to be performed for sympathectomy effect and pain control in the affected extremity during the immediate postoperative period.",0,,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,10.1097/00000637-199802000-00006,Ann Plast Surg. 1998 Feb;40(2):141-4. doi: 10.1097/00000637-199802000-00006.,"Zukowski M, Lord J, Ash K, Shouse B, Getz S, Robb G.",1998,9495461,"gracilis flap to extremities, no info on face",25,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Muscle bow traction method for dynamic facial reanimation,"A muscle bow traction method was developed for dynamic facial reanimation utilizing the masseter muscle and a fascial sling. The principle of this method is that the sling around the muscle pulls the oral commissure laterally and backward by the restoring force of the muscle from its relaxed position to its contracted position. The surgical procedure is simple. The sling is passed around the anterior half of the muscle so that the muscle can be bowed anteriorly at its center by the sling. One end of the sling is sutured to the center of the orbicularis oris and the dermis in front of the nasolabial fold, and the other end is sutured to the lower lip and oral commissure. This method was applied to 3 patients with facial palsy and to 1 patient with oral cancer. The restored motion of the oral commissure ranged from 5 to 8 mm when clenching the jaws. The concept of this method differs from those of other muscle transposition methods for facial reanimation in that the force acts at a right angle to the muscle contraction. The advantage of this method is that it is less invasive to the muscle and is a simpler procedure than other conventional muscle transposition methods.",0,,0,3,3,3,4,1,0,10.1097/00000637-199910000-00002,Ann Plast Surg. 1999 Oct;43(4):354-8. doi: 10.1097/00000637-199910000-00002.,"Maegawa J, Saijo M, Murasawa S.",1999,10517460,,3,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,Microsurgical strategies in 74 patients for restoration of dynamic depressor muscle mechanism: A neglected target in facial reanimation,"The facial depressor muscles are an essential component of a full denture smile. In addition, the depressor muscles are actively used to express other human emotions such as sadness, anger, depression, and sorrow. Despite advances in microsurgical techniques, it is surprising how little effort has been directed toward reanimation of the lower lip. This article presents innovative approaches used in 74 patients by the senior author since 1981 for the dynamic reanimation of depressor muscle function. The surgical techniques include transfer of the anterior belly of the digastric muscle (n = 22) and transfer of the platysma muscle (n = 26) as a pedicled muscle to the corner of the mouth. Other surgical interventions used are the mini- hypoglossal nerve transfer to the cervicofacial branch of the ipsilateral facial nerve (n = 20), direct neurotization of the depressor muscles (n = 6), and facial-to-facial nerve transfer. The depressor muscle function was graded by four observers after reviewing standard preoperative and postoperative videotapes. Rating of the functional and aesthetic results was done according to the following arbitrary scale: excellent (2), good (1.5), moderate (1), fair (0.5), and poor (0). Sixty-nine percent of the patients who had a digastric muscle transfer displayed good to excellent results, and 24 percent showed moderate restoration of the depressor mechanism postoperatively. Eighty-three percent of patients who had platysma transfer to the lower lip demonstrated good to excellent outcome, and 11 percent had moderate depressor muscle function. In the hypoglossal nerve transfer group, 72 percent of the patients achieved good to excellent results and 15 percent had moderate function of the depressor mechanism. Of the patients who underwent direct neurotization, 34 percent showed good to excellent depressor muscle function postoperatively and 66 percent achieved fair depressor muscle function. Excellent outcome was noted in the patient with VII to VII nerve transfer.

It yielded superior cosmetic results, less donor-site morbidity and required a shorter operating time. In more complex congenital facial hypoplastic syndromes, or following extensive surgery in the digastric triangle, the anterior belly of the digastric muscle may be absent or damaged.

Study design: A retrospective review of patients undergoing facial nerve repair from 1963-1997. Methods: One hundred and three patients underwent surgical intervention designed to repair a disrupted facial nerve. All procedures were performed by one of the senior surgeons (M.M.)

Twenty percent of patients had a poor outcome. There was a slight worsening of outcome with increased time to repair. Patients with a neoplastic etiology of nerve paralysis tended to have a worse outcome. Conclusions: Facial nerve grafting is most successful if intervention is undertaken at or near the time of initial injury.

Pub-med,Hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis: assessment of clinical results and patient benefit for facial nerve palsy following acoustic neuroma excision,"Despite advances in neuro-otological techniques permanent complete facial palsy may still occur in up to 10% of patients undergoing removal of cerebellopontine angle tumours. Hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis is the procedure of choice in our unit for facial reanimation in such patients and below we report the results of hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis performed on 29 patients. Assessment of patient benefit from hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis was obtained using a questionnaire based on the Glasgow Benefit Inventory. The results showed all patients to have an improvement in their House Brackmann grade following hypoglossal-facial anastomosis with 65% achieving grade III or better. Of the 20 patients who completed the questionnaire, 18 showed a positive benefit (median score 59.5, range 40-77). There was a significant correlation (P < 0.045) between the Glasgow benefit inventory score and House Brackmann grade. Outcome was not affected by the time interval between the acoustic neuroma surgery and performing the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, sex or length of follow-up. However the Glasgow benefit score was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.023) with younger patients showing more benefit independent of improvement in facial nerve function.",3,,0,0,9,9,2,1,0,10.1046/j.1365-2273.2000.00348.x,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci. 2000 Jun;25(3):219-26. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2273.2000.00348.x.,"Sood S, Anthony R, Homer JJ, Van Hille P, Fenwick JD.",2000,10944053,"neg: food spillage, speech worsened, embarrassed to eat in public, trouble clearing buccal debris",29,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Temporalis muscle transfer for facial paralysis: a further refinement,"Facial nerve paralysis can occur due to failure of the central driving mechanism (nuclear or supranuclear pathology), failure of the conduit between the brainstem and the peripheral musculature (the facial nerve), or failure of the peripheral end organ (the neuromuscular system). Where the peripheral neuromuscular system fails, the options for dynamic reanimation include a regional muscle transfer driven by another ipsilateral cranial nerve, or a free muscle transfer driven by the contralateral facial nerve. Temporalis muscle transfer is an example of regional muscle transfer and has been used since early in the twentieth century.

Methods: We report the cases of three patients who underwent wide excision of tumors of the cheek region, operations that resulted in tissue defects and facial palsy. Defect reconstruction and facial reanimation was accomplished in one stage through functional muscle transplantation. Results: Follow-up of more than 1 year showed good symmetry at rest and reanimation of the corner of the mouth in all cases, but one patient, in which the ipsilateral facial main trunk was used as motor nerve supply to the transplanted muscle, developed significant muscle contracture and binding of the cheek skin.

Pub-med,Long-term outcome of gold eyelid weights in patients with facial nerve palsy,"Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of upper eyelid gold weight implants in managing paralytic lagophthalmos and to compare two surgical techniques for their insertion. Study design: Retrospective case series. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: One hundred four patients had a gold weight implanted for paralytic lagophthalmos between 1982 and 1996 at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Each patient had more than 2 years of follow-up of lid load function. Main outcome measures: The effectiveness of gold weights in reanimating eyelid closure, mean duration of gold weight retention, reasons for removal, and complications resulting from a gold weight; these outcomes were also compared using two surgical techniques for gold weight insertion. Results: One hundred three patients maintained corneal integrity. At the time of assessment, 46 patients had had their lid loads removed from their eyelids, and 58 lid loads remained in situ. Of the lid loads that were removed, 78% were because the facial nerve had recovered. The remaining 22% were removed because of cosmetic dissatisfaction (7 patients), the lid load becoming too superficial (6 patients), migration (3 patients), partial extrusion (1 patient), and ptosis resulting from too heavy a weight (1 patient). Conclusion: Gold weights are well tolerated and effective in managing paralytic lagophthalmos. An open surgical technique with direct suture fixation of the gold weight to the tarsal plate produced fewer complications than inserting the lid load into a prefashioned tissue pocket in the preseptal space through a small lateral skin incision.",0,,0,0,9,5,4,1,0,10.1097/00129492-200105000-00022,Otol Neurotol. 2001 May;22(3):397-400. doi: 10.1097/00129492-200105000-00022.,"Harrisberg BP, Singh RP, Croxson GR, Taylor RF, McCluskey PJ.",2001,11347647,"Positive Outcomes: corneal integrity and ocular comfort Negative Outcomes: cosmetic dissatisfaction, lid load becoming too superficial, migration, partial extrusion, ptosis reulting from too heavy wight",104,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Temporal galeal fascia cover of custom-made gold lid weights for correction of paralytic lagophthalmos: long-term evaluation of an improved technique,"Background: Chronic paralytic lagophthalmos is a condition that is often conservatively treated with ophthalmic ointments and eye drops, but usually requires definitive surgical correction. Purpose: An effective modification of the gold lid loading technique is described, which we have found to be the simplest and most reliable method for lid reanimation. Material: After empiric evaluations with lead fisherman's weights 'glued' to the eyelid, a custom-made gold lid weight is made by a jeweller on the basis of the tarsal dimensions of the individual patient, and then sutured to the tarsus under local anaesthesia and covered with a fine sheet of temporal galea. Other ancillary procedures (lower lid suspension, lateral tarsal strip, lateral tarsoplasty) are added as required. Methods: Between 1990 and 1996, 27 patients underwent this type of surgery, of whom 24 were re-evaluated after a mean follow-up period of 73.2 months (range 36-96 months), 14 of these for a minimum of 5 years. Results: None of the gold weights was extruded, all 24 patients experienced marked improvement of their dry-eye symptoms and expressed a high degree of satisfaction. Six patients underwent further minor surgery (lateral McLaughlin tarsorrhaphy) in order to improve relative underaction. Two patients had ptosis (less than 2 mm of asymmetry) of the affected side but refused further correction.

Embase,Neurovascular musculus obliquus internus abdominis flap free transfer for facial reanimation in a single stage,"A study of the anatomy and transplantation of the musculus obliquus internus abdominis with a neurovascular pedicle transfer for facial reanimation in one stage is presented. Eleven adult cadavers (22 face sides) were dissected to observe the shape, thickness, innervation, and blood supply, of the musculus obliquus internus abdominis. The blood supply of this muscle primarily comes from the musculus obliquus internus abdominis branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery (diameter, 1.3 ¬¨¬± 0.2 mm), but it can also come from the eleventh intercostal artery (diameter, 1.14 ¬¨¬± 0.3 mm) and the infracostal artery (diameter, 1.5 ¬¨¬± 0.2 mm). The branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery and its vena comitans, or the infracostal artery and its vena comitans, could be anastomosed for muscle transplantation. The innervation of the musculus obliquus internus abdominis comes from the tenth and eleventh intercostal nerves (length, 12.7 ¬¨¬± 1.5 cm) and the infracostal nerve (length, 12.9 ¬¨¬± 1.3 cm). The eleventh intercostal nerve and the infracostal nerve were selected for anastomosis of muscle transplantation. From November of 1995 to November of 1999, 14 patients with long established facial paralysis were treated with transplantation of a musculus obliquus internus abdominis flap in one stage and were followed for 10 months to 6 years. In 13 patients, the dynamic functions of the transplanted muscles were restored, the obliqueness of the mouth and philtrum while static was corrected, and the facial muscle activities while smiling were harmonized. The eyelids of the paralyzed side could be closed postoperatively, indicating that the function of the orbicularis oculi of the paralyzed side was restored. The single-stage transplantation of a free musculus obliquus internus abdominis flap with one vascular, multi-nerve pedicle is a new method for facial reanimation in the treatment of long established facial paralysis. Because of the simplicity of the procedure and the completeness of the functional reanimation of the paralyzed facial muscles, compared with the results of other free muscle flap transfers, it is an ideal procedure for facial reanimation.",0,,2,0,9,9,4,1,0,10.1097/00006534-200211000-00007,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002) 110:6 (1430-1440).

Pub-med,Cross-face nerve graft with free-muscle transfer for reanimation of the paralyzed face: a comparative study of the single-stage and two-stage procedures,"The most accepted method for reanimation of the paralyzed face is the two-stage method that combines cross-face nerve graft with free-muscle transfer. Although the results of reconstruction with this method are satisfactory, there is an excessive delay between stages, which prolongs the period of rehabilitation. In 1995, Kumar overcame this and presented his preliminary results from a single-stage transfer of the gracilis. We compared the long-term results of the single-stage with the two-stage method of reconstruction. Patients selected the method of reconstruction on the basis of the information, photographs of scars, and video recording of results given to them at a special facial palsy clinic. Ten patients selected the single-stage reconstruction and 15 selected the two-stage reconstruction. The mean follow-up period was 3 years. The results of the two methods are comparable, with 90 percent of the patients who underwent the single-stage and 93 percent of those who underwent the two-stage procedures having good and fair results. However, the two-stage method scored good symmetry at rest in 67 percent, compared with 20 percent for the single-stage method. There were fewer complications with the single-stage method, and none of the patients had any problems relating to the donor site. The period of rehabilitation was reduced by 10 months with the single-stage method.",1,,1,3,9,9,8,1,0,10.1097/00006534-200202000-00006,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2002 Feb;109(2):451-62; discussion 463-4. doi: 10.1097/00006534-200202000-00006.,"Kumar PA, Hassan KM.",2002,11818819,"Tools: modified O'Brien point system,questionnaire   Outcome:symmetry, donor-site problems, numbness, widening of scar, osteoarthritis, persistent swelling, patient satisfaction",15,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Anterior belly of digastric muscle transfer: a useful technique in head and neck surgery,"Background: Permanent loss of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve (MMBFN) may result from an inadvertent injury or an intentional sacrifice during tumor resection. This may occur in isolation or as a part of total facial nerve palsy. The loss of the MMBFN results in paralysis of the depressors of the ipsilateral lower lip with troublesome cosmetic and functional deficits. Method: A series of 14 patients with permanent loss of the MMBFN during resection of head and neck tumors were treated with the anterior belly of digastric muscle transfer (ABDMT). The loss of the MMBFN occurred in isolation in five patients and formed a part of total facial nerve palsy in nine. Immediate reconstruction was performed on nine patients, and it was done as a secondary procedure in the remainder. Two patients in the latter group had prior facial reanimation, although the paralyzed lower lip was not reconstructed. Results: The average follow-up period was 23.2 (range, 3-48) months. Satisfactory results were achieved in all of the patients, although revision of the ABDMT was required in one patient. Conclusions: ABDMT is a simple and reliable reconstructive technique for restoring the depressor function of the lower lip resulting from MMBFN palsy. It is the treatment of choice during primary extirpative surgery for head and neck tumors when the MMBFN requires sacrifice for tumor clearance or is inadvertently injured. The reconstructive options for MMBFN palsy, particularly in the absence of the anterior belly of digastric muscle, are discussed.",0,,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,10.1002/hed.10150,Head Neck. 2002 Oct;24(10):947-54. doi: 10.1002/hed.10150.,Tan ST.,2002,12369074,Grading system not specified,14,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,The three-stage concept to optimize the results of microsurgical reanimation of the paralyzed face,"From the authors three-dimensional video analyses they had to learn that the advantages of a one-stage procedure is outweighed by far by the disadvantages. A three-stage concept to a one-stage procedure was preferred for the following reasons: 1. Safety of having a cross-face nerve graft to cover the distance from the healthy facial nerve to the nerve of the muscle transplant without problems and without the danger of tension on the nerve suture line because of shortage of the muscle nerve. 2. Independence of anatomical variations like a very proximal muscle hilus in the latissimus dorsi muscle e.g., resulting in a too short muscle nerve. 3. Only face-lift incisions are necessary without the need of an additional incision in the nasolabial fold while using a cross-face nerve graft. 4. Freedom of positioning the muscle graft on the paralyzed side with free choice of the position of the transplant hilus. 5. The superficial temporal vessels can be used for microvascular anastomoses. 6. Prevention of a scar in the submandibular region with its tendency of hypertrophy, especially if it is connected to the preauricular incision. Different functional territories of one muscle transplant for eye closure and for smile is only possible in combination with two cross-face nerve grafts. Further on the three-dimensional video analysis showed clearly that Final surgical corrections for improvement of the static and dynamic symmetry should be performed. when the muscle transplant or the transposed muscle have gained their final functional result, which is often not before one or one and a half year after muscle transplantation. Therefore a three-stage concept is needed for the majority of patients. Detailed analyses of the movements in the different regions and the comparison of both sides clarify preoperatively the indication for the operative techniques to be used, and describe exactly the improvement of the overall result. It is not only possible to show, eg, the better positioning of the alar of the nose by a nasolabial dermal suspension plasty on the paralyzed side in millimeter, but also the influence on the relation of all the different points in the face (Fig. 5). The comparison of the right and the left side gives exact data on the symmetry of the face on rest and during the different movements. Of course, also qualities of facial reanimation like prevention of mass movements or synkinesias are detected in the three-dimensional graphs of all the points at the same time or in the repeated reviews of the original movement in the original video sequence. In conclusion, three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements became an important tool for online planning of operative procedures for the individual patient, and an excellent tool for comparative studies of different operative concepts and alternative operative techniques within a standardized registry of one center treating facial palsy or within international multicenter studies.",1,,2,0,1,3,1,2,0,10.1016/s0094-1298(02)00024-x,Clin Plast Surg. 2002 Oct;29(4):461-82. doi: 10.1016/s0094-1298(02)00024-x.,"Frey M, Giovanoli P.",2002,12484599,three-dimensional video analysis,56,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,"['Alt flap', 'Latissimus dorsi flap']",Alt ,Latissimus dorsi flap,

Pub-med,Upper labial deficiency in Mobius syndrome: a previously unreported feature and its correction,"Bilateral facial palsy in M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome remains one of the greatest challenges in reconstructive plastic surgery. Facial reanimation is an invaluable aid to such patients because it allows for greater social interaction by means of the ability to smile. In performing facial reanimation surgery on patients with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome, it is the observation of the senior author (Harrison) that upper labial deficiency is a consistent and previously unreported feature of the syndrome. It has been the practice of the senior author to perform upper labial augmentation on M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome patients by insertion of a lipodermal autograft, in addition to facial reanimation.

All nine possessed bilateral facial palsy and upper labial deficiency in addition to other abnormalities consistent with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome. Six patients underwent bilateral facial reanimation and upper labial augmentation alone. One patient refused facial reanimation surgery but consented to upper labial augmentation. One patient, with concomitant micrognathia, underwent bilateral facial reanimation, upper labial augmentation, and insertion of a Silastic chin implant. In one patient, a child who also exhibited micrognathia, bilateral facial reanimation alone was carried out, with further procedures for upper labial and chin cosmesis being postponed until adulthood. The indication for performing upper labial augmentation was cosmetic. The procedure improved upper labial appearance and restored balance to the mouth. Patients also expressed higher satisfaction with eating and drinking, which they related to the improved fullness of the upper lip. This was before the facial reanimation had become functional. Upper labial deficiency warrants addition to the list of facial features of M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome and is something that must be assessed in the context of facial reanimation surgery.",0,,0,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1097/01.PRS.0000090721.16566.B3,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2003 Dec;112(7):1762-7. doi: 10.1097/01.PRS.0000090721.16566.B3.,"Sabbagh W, Shafighian A, Harrison DH.",2003,14663218,"Tools: clinical evaluation Outcomes: cosmesis, satisfaction while eating and drinking,  LD flaps",9,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,Arterial and venous anatomical features of the pectoralis minor muscle flap pedicle,"The pectoralis minor muscle has been used as an innervated, vascularized, free-muscle graft in the field of facial reanimation for 20 years. Throughout this period, several centers have demonstrated consistent success with functional muscle transfer; however, opinions regarding the arterial pedicle of the flap have varied. The lateral thoracic and thoracoacromial arteries have been proposed as the predominant arterial sources. It has been the experience of our unit that a vessel (not described in anatomy textbooks) arising directly from the axillary artery and entering the muscle from its dorsal surface provides the dominant supply to the flap and is capable of sustaining it for free-tissue transfer. The vascular pedicle encountered was recorded and photographed in 97 consecutive cases in which the pectoralis minor muscle flap was raised. The findings demonstrated that the dominant supply to the muscle was from a single artery in 77 percent of cases and took the form of an artery arising directly from the axillary vessel in 72 percent of cases.

Pub-med,Neurovascular free-muscle transfer for the treatment of established facial paralysis following ablative surgery in the parotid region,"Neurovascular free-muscle transfer for facial reanimation was performed as a secondary reconstructive procedure for 45 patients with facial paralysis resulting from ablative surgery in the parotid region. This intervention differs from neurovascular free-muscle transfer for treatment of established facial paralysis resulting from conditions such as congenital dysfunction, unresolved Bell palsy, Hunt syndrome, or intracranial morbidity, with difficulties including selection of recipient vessels and nerves, and requirements for soft-tissue augmentation. This article describes the authors' operative procedure for neurovascular free-muscle transfer after ablative surgery in the parotid region. Gracilis muscle (n = 24) or latissimus dorsi muscle (n = 21) was used for transfer. With gracilis transfer, recipient vessels comprised the superficial temporal vessels in 12 patients and the facial vessels in 12. For latissimus dorsi transfer, recipient vessels comprised the facial vessels in 16 patients and the superior thyroid artery and superior thyroid or internal jugular vein in four. Facial vessels on the contralateral side were used with interpositional graft of radial vessels in the remaining patient with latissimus dorsi transfer. Cross-face nerve grafting was performed before muscle transfer in 22 patients undergoing gracilis transfer. In the remaining two gracilis patients, the ipsilateral facial nerve stump was used as the primary recipient nerve. Dermal fat flap overlying the gracilis muscle was used for cheek augmentation in one patient. In the other 23 patients, only the gracilis muscle was used. With latissimus dorsi transfer, the ipsilateral facial nerve stump was used as the recipient nerve in three patients, and a cross-face nerve graft was selected as the recipient nerve in six. The contralateral facial nerve was selected as the recipient nerve in 12 patients, and a thoracodorsal nerve from the latissimus dorsi muscle segment was crossed through the upper lip to the primary recipient branches. A soft-tissue flap was transferred simultaneously with the latissimus muscle segment in three patients. Contraction of grafted muscle was not observed in two patients with gracilis transfer and in three patients with latissimus dorsi transfer. In one patient with gracilis transfer and one patient with latissimus dorsi transfer, acquired muscle contraction was excessive, resulting in unnatural smile animation. The recipient nerves for both of these patients were the ipsilateral facial nerve stumps, which were dissected by opening the facial nerve canal in the mastoid process. From the standpoint of operative technique, the one-stage transfer for latissimus dorsi muscle appears superior.

Pub-med,Dynamic reconstruction of eye closure by muscle transposition or functional muscle transplantation in facial palsy,"For patients with facial palsy, lagophthalmus is often a more serious problem than the inability to smile. Dynamic reconstruction of eye closure by muscle transposition or by free functional muscle transplantation offers a good solution for regaining near-normal eye protection without the need for implants. This is the first quantitative study of three-dimensional preoperative and postoperative lid movements in patients treated for facial paralysis. Between February of 1998 and April of 2002, 44 patients were treated for facial palsy, including reconstruction of eye closure. Temporalis muscle transposition to the eye was used in 34 cases, and a regionally differentiated part of a free gracilis muscle transplant after double cross-face nerve grafting was used in 10 cases. Patients' facial movements were documented by a three-dimensional video analysis system preoperatively and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. For this comparative study, only the data of patients with preoperative and 12-month postoperative measurements were included. In the 27 patients with a final result after temporalis muscle transposition for eye closure, the distance between the upper and lower eyelid points during eye closing (as for sleep) was reduced from 10.33 +/- 2.43 mm (mean +/- SD) preoperatively to 5.84 +/- 4.34 mm postoperatively on the paralyzed side, compared with 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm preoperatively and postoperatively on the contralateral healthy side. In the resting position, preoperative values for the paralyzed side changed from 15.11 +/- 1.92 mm preoperatively to 13.46 +/- 1.94 mm postoperatively, compared with 12.17 +/- 2.02 mm preoperatively and 12.05 +/- 1.95 mm postoperatively on the healthy side. In the nine patients with a final result after surgery using a part of the free gracilis muscle transplant reinnervated by a zygomatic branch of the contralateral healthy side through a cross-face nerve graft, eyelid closure changed from 10.21 +/- 2.72 mm to 1.68 +/- 1.35 mm, compared with 13.70 +/- 1.56 mm to 6.63 +/- 1.51 mm preoperatively. The average closure for the healthy side was from 11.20 +/- 3.11 mm to 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm preoperatively and from 12.70 +/- 1.95 mm to 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm postoperatively. In three cases, the resting tonus of the part of the gracilis muscle transplant around the eye had increased to an extent that muscle weakening became necessary. Temporalis muscle transposition and free functional muscle transplantation for reanimation of the eye and mouth at the same time are reliable methods for reconstructing eye closure, with clinically adequate results. Detailed analysis of the resulting facial movements led to an important improvement of the authors' operative techniques within the last few years. Thus, the number of secondary operative corrections could be significantly reduced. These qualitative and quantitative studies of the reconstructed lid movements by three-dimensional video analysis support the authors' clinical concept of temporalis muscle transposition being the first-choice method in adult patients with facial palsy. In children, free muscle transplantation is preferred for eye closure, so as not to interfere with the growth of the face by transposition of a masticatory muscle. In addition, a higher degree of central plasticity in children might be expected.",0,,2,1,5,9,4,1,0,10.1097/01.prs.0000133028.02303.16,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2004 Sep 15;114(4):865-75. doi: 10.1097/01.prs.0000133028.02303.16.,"Frey M, Giovanoli P, Tzou CH, Kropf N, Friedl S.",2004,15468391,"Tools: clinical evaluatio Outcomes: distance between upper and lower eyelid (preop vs postop), symmetry, synkinesia",44,6,24,,,no nerve transfer,,,['Alt flap'],Alt ,,
Pub-med,Facial reanimation by transplantation of a microneurovascular muscle: long-term follow-up,"The two-stage operation for reanimation of long-standing facial paralysis by cross-facial nerve grafting and later free microneurovascular muscle transfer has been the treatment of choice for nearly 25 years. However, the functional outcome may be unpredictable. We therefore need to know more about the factors that influence the final result. We have recorded the long-term results of microneurovascular surgery in facial paralysis, and evaluated which factors influenced the functional outcome. Twenty-seven of 40 patients aged 7 to 65 years (mean 40) operated on at Helsinki University Hospital between 1986 and 2000 were available for interview and video recording. The gracilis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior muscles were used for microneurovascular transfer in 11, 10, and 6 cases, respectively. The outcome of microneurovascular muscle transfer was graded on House's scale 1 to 6. The mean follow-up period was 8.5 years (range 2 to 15). Sixteen patients (59%) displayed only mild or moderate dysfunction (grades 2 to 3) after reconstruction. In 8 patients (30%) dysfunction was graded as moderately severe, and in 3 (11%) as severe. There was a correlation between final functional outcome and the follow-up time after microneurovascular facial reanimation. The longer the follow-up time after muscle transplantation the poorer the functional result (p = 0.003). Twenty-one patients (78%) considered that their quality of life was better or much better after facial reanimation. Patients' satisfaction correlated with a good functional result.",0,,1,1,0,9,2,1,0,10.1080/02844310410029138,Scand J Plast Reconstr Surg Hand Surg. 2004;38(5):272-6. doi: 10.1080/02844310410029138.,"Yl‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫-Kotola TM, Kauhanen MS, Asko-Seljavaara SL.",2004,15513597,"Tools:HB score Outcomes:facial movement, perception of quality of life,  gracilis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior ",27,,,",Other free flap type:serratus anterior muscle,","gracilis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior ",no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Multivectored suture suspension: a minimally invasive technique for reanimation of the paralyzed face,"Background: Despite advanced techniques for reanimation of the lower face, many patients opt for static suspension procedures, which are less invasive and have a relatively short recovery period. However, even static suspension procedures require general anesthesia, overnight hospital stay, and significant soft tissue manipulation. We present a minimally invasive technique, the multivectored suture suspension, which addresses these drawbacks. Objectives: To study the technical feasibility and efficacy of the multivectored suture suspension technique in the paralyzed face. Design: The study was carried out prospectively in 12 patients with House-Brackmann grade 6 facial paralysis. Nine patients presented within 6 months of tumor resection and 3 patients presented more than 1 year after surgery. Main outcome measures: The parameters evaluated were (1). restoration of nasal breathing; (2). improvement of drooling; (3). restoration of normal speech; (4). cosmetic results; and (5). total surgical time. Results: With an average follow-up of 14 months, patient evaluation of the outcome parameters was as follows: (1). 10 patients (83%) reported significant and 2 (17%) reported moderate restoration of nasal breathing; (2). 10 patients (83%) reported significant improvement and 2 (17%) reported modest drooling improvement; (3). 8 patients (66%) reported significant improvement and 4 (34%) reported modest improvement of speech; (4). 9 patients (75%) reported complete satisfaction and 3 (25%) reported moderate satisfaction with cosmesis. The average surgical time was 46 minutes. Three revisions were required for suture failure. Conclusions: The multivectored suture suspension technique is a minimally invasive, reversible method of lower facial reanimation that provides improved cosmesis with restoration of nasal breathing. It can be performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting, thereby reducing morbidity and cost.",0,,0,0,0,9,7,1,0,10.1001/archfaci.6.3.197,Arch Facial Plast Surg. 2004 May-Jun;6(3):197-201. doi: 10.1001/archfaci.6.3.197.,"Alex JC, Nguyen DB.",2004,15148131,"Tools: patient report Outcomes: nasal breathing improvement, drooling, patient satisfaction multivectored suture suspension technique",12,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Free proximal gracilis muscle and its skin paddle compound flap transplantation for complex facial paralysis,"Gracilis functioning free-muscle transplantation for the correction of pure facial paralysis has been a preferred method used by many reconstructive microsurgeons. However, for complex facial paralysis, the deficits include facial paralysis along with soft-tissue, mucosa, and/or skin defects. No adequate solution has been proposed. Treatment requests in those patients are not only for facial reanimation but also for correction of the defects. Of 161 patients with facial paralysis treated with gracilis functioning free-muscle transplantation from 1986 to 2002, eight patients (5 percent) presented with complex deficits requiring not only facial reanimation but also aesthetic correction of tissue defects. The tissue defects included an intraoral defect created following contracture release (one patient), infra-auricular radiation dermatitis with contour depression (one patient), temporal depression following a temporalis muscle-fascia transfer (one patient), ear deformity (two patients), and infra-auricular atrophic tissue with contour depression (three patients). A compound flap, consisting of a gracilis muscle with its overlying skin paddle separated into two components, was transferred for simultaneous correction of both problems. The blood supply to the gracilis and to the skin paddle originated from the same source vessel and therefore required the anastomosis of only one set of vessels. The versatility of this compound flap allows for a wide arc of rotation of the skin paddle around the muscle. All flaps were transferred successfully without complications. Satisfactory results of facial reanimation were recorded in five patients after all stages were completed. The remaining three patients are undergoing physical therapy and waiting for revision of the skin paddle.",0,,1,1,2,2,4,2,0,10.1097/01.PRS.0000096092.09655.63,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2004 Jan;113(1):126-32; discussion 133-5. doi: 10.1097/01.PRS.0000096092.09655.63.,"Chuang DC, Mardini S, Lin SH, Chen HC.",2004,14707630,,8,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,New one-stage nerve pedicle grafting technique using the great auricular nerve for reconstruction of facial nerve defects,"A new one-stage nerve pedicle grafting technique, employing a vascularized great auricular nerve graft, was used to repair a facial nerve defect. The facial nerve of a 39-year-old woman with facial schwannoma was resected, and an island vascularized great auricular nerve graft from the ipsilateral side was transferred to bridge a 4 cm long defect of the buccal branch. Postoperatively, rapid nerve sprouting through the vascularized nerve graft and excellent facial reanimation were obtained within 6 months after surgery. This method in one-stage using a vascularized nerve graft is technically easy, requires a short operating time, has minimal donor-site morbidity, and leads to successful nerve regeneration postoperatively.",5,,0,0,10,7,4,1,0,10.1055/s-2004-829998,J Reconstr Microsurg. 2004 Jul;20(5):357-61. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-829998.,"Koshima I, Nanba Y, Tsutsui T, Takahashi Y, Itoh S.",2004,15237353,Negative Outcomes: hypesthesia at the donor posterior auricular sites greater auricular nerve graft,1,,,Other type of nerve graft:Great auricular nerve graft,greater auricular nerve graft,Great auricular nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,The conjoint medial circumflex femoral perforator and gracilis muscle free flap: Anatomical study and clinical use for complex facial paralysis reconstruction,"Background: The aim of this study was to establish the anatomic basis of the conjoint medial circumflex femoral perforator and gracilis muscle flap and to expand the use of this flap in complex facial paralysis reconstruction. Methods: An anatomic study was initially undertaken to record the existence, consistency, and diameter of musculocutaneous perforators emanating from the proximal third of the gracilis muscle to provide blood supply to the overlying fascia, subcutaneous fat, and skin. In a total of 20 clinical cases of gracilis muscle harvesting, the aforementioned anatomical data were recorded during flap dissection. At least one musculocutaneus perforator, consisting of one artery and two accompanying veins (vein caliber > 0.3 mm) was found in 95 percent of cases. Results: The anatomical study was followed by successful use of the conjoint flap for reconstruction of longstanding facial palsy accompanied by a soft-tissue defect of the cheek. In the first stage, cross-face nerve grafting was performed. In the second stage, free transfer of the conjoint flap, consisting of the proximal third of the gracilis muscle and the overlying subcutaneous fat, was performed to the face. The only connection between the two components of the conjoint flap was one musculocutaneous perforator. When the flap was inset, the muscle was used for facial reanimation and partial obliteration of the soft-tissue defect, while the subcutaneous fat was used to obliterate the rest of the defect Conclusion: The proposed technique ensured symmetry of the face, on both rest and animation, and obliteration of the cheek deformity.",1,,1,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1097/01.prs.0000187171.60689.48,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005) 116:6 (1589-1595).

Embase,Neurovascularized free short head of the biceps femoris muscle transfer for one-stage reanimation of facial paralysis,"The single-stage technique for cross-face reanimation of the paralyzed face without nerve graft is an improvement over the two-stage procedure because it results in early reinnervation of the transferred muscle and shortens the period of rehabilitation. On the basis of an anatomic investigation, the short head of the biceps femoris muscle with attached lateral intermuscular septum of the thigh was identified as a new candidate for microneurovascular free muscle transfer. The authors performed one-stage transfer of the short head of the biceps femoris muscle with a long motor nerve for reanimation of established facial paralysis in seven patients. The dominant nutrient vessels of the short head were the profunda perforators (second or third) in six patients and the direct branches from the popliteal vessels in one patient. The recipient vessels were the facial vessels in all cases. The length of the motor nerve of the short head ranged from 10 to 16 cm, and it was sutured directly to several zygomatic and buccal branches of the contralateral facial nerve in six patients. One patient required an interpositional nerve graft of 3 cm to reach the suitable facial nerve branches on the intact side. The period required for initial voluntary movement of the transferred muscles ranged from 4 to 10 months after the procedures. The period of postoperative follow-up ranged from 5 to 42 months. Transfer of the vascularized innervated short head of the biceps femoris muscle is thought to be an alternative for one-stage reconstruction of the paralyzed face because of the reliable vascular anatomy of the muscle and because it allows two teams to operate together without the need to reposition the patient. The nerve to the short head of the biceps femoris enters the side opposite the vascular pedicle of the muscle belly, and this unique relationship between the vascular pedicle and the motor nerve is anatomically suitable for one-stage reconstruction of the paralyzed face. As much as to 16 cm of the nerve can be harvested, and the nerve is long enough to reach the contralateral intact facial nerve in almost all cases. The lateral intermuscular septum, which is attached to the short head, provides ""anchor/suture-bearing"" tissue, allowing reliable fixations to the zygoma and the upper and lower lips to be achieved. In addition, the scar and deformity of the donor site are acceptable, and loss of this muscle does not result in donor-site dysfunction.",4,,2,3,0,9,8,3,0,10.1097/01.PRS.0000149405.89201.9E,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005) 115:2 (394-405).

Embase,Cortical adaptation to restoration of smiling after free muscle transfer innervated by the nerve to the masseter,"Background: The child with M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome presenting for facial reanimation presents a difficult challenge. When bilateral paralysis and paresis preclude use of the contralateral facial nerve, the authors' preferred donor nerve for reinnervation of free muscle transfer is a branch of the trigeminal nerve, the ipsilateral nerve to the masseter. Methods: The authors have used a branch of the trigeminal nerve as a donor for three children with M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome. Results: Of three children with M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome, two are now able to smile independently of jaw closure. One child is now 2.6 years past bilateral free gracilis transfers completed at age 13.2 years. The second child is 8.2 years past free gracilis transfer to the left side of the face performed at age 7.6 years. The third child is 5.6 years past bilateral facial reanimation with free latissimus and free gracilis flaps completed at age 13.4 years. This child is notable to smile independently of jaw closure. The two who are able to smile independently of jaw closure demonstrated maximum excursion of the lateral commissure on the affected sides when asked to smile without biting; however, they demonstrated minimal excursion of the lateral commissure on the affected sides when asked to bite without trying to smile. Conclusions: These findings indicate that smiling independently of jaw closure is attainable with reanimation to the masseteric branch, refuting previous speculations. Early age at operation and absence of complete bilateral paralysis in these two children may have contributed to cortical adaptation to smiling.",5,,1,0,3,2,4,1,0,10.1097/01.PRS.0000160266.81504.71,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005) 115:6 (1472-1479).

Embase,Serratus anterior in vivo contractile force study,"Background: A major limitation of functional muscle transfer for facial and intrinsic hand reanimation is the inability to predict the force that will be generated by the transplanted muscle. Methods: The authors studied the contractile force of the slips of the serratus anterior in situ in 10 patients and tested the gracilis muscle in four subjects as a control. Results: Mean contractile force generated by each serratus slip was 0.178 pound (range, 0.019 to 0.797 pound). This compares favorably with the maximum force generated by smiling (0.307 pound). Muscle strength correlated strongly with age (r = -0.805, p = 0.005). The lowest slip generated less force than those above it (0.133 pound versus 0.191 pound); this difference did not reach statistical significance. When the strength of the lowest slip is compared with the more superior slips as a percentage of total force generated by the slips (to compensate for the effect of age on muscle strength), the lowest slip was significantly weaker (18.6 percent of total force versus 25.5 percent of total force, p = 0.013). Mean contractile force generated by the gracilis was 0.963 pound, significantly different from that generated by a serratus anterior slip (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Each serratus slip could potentially be used to generate a separate force vector for facial reanimation. Further separation of the flap along preexisting fascial planes may allow generation of up to 10 independent force vectors, making the serratus anterior muscle flap an attractive option for facial reanimation and possibly intrinsic hand muscle reconstruction.",0,,1,0,0,0,5,2,0,10.1097/01.prs.0000176254.28792.8c,Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005) 116:3 (839-845).

Pub-med,"Reliability of the ""Sydney,"" ""Sunnybrook,"" and ""House Brackmann"" facial grading systems to assess voluntary movement and synkinesis after facial nerve paralysis","Objective: To investigate the extent of within-system reliability and between-system correlation for the ""Sydney"" and ""Sunnybrook"" systems of grading facial nerve paralysis, and to examine the interobserver reliability and agreement of the ""House Brackmann"" grading system. Study design: A fixed-effects reliability study in which 6 otolaryngologists viewed videotapes of patients with facial nerve paralysis. Setting: University and medical Centers. Patients: Patients with unilateral lower motor neurone facial nerve dysfunction greater than 1 year after onset, none of whom had undergone surgical reanimation procedures. Intervention Twenty-one patients with facial nerve paralysis were videotaped while they performed a protocol of facial movements. Six otolaryngologists viewed the videotapes and scored them with the Sydney and Sunnybrook systems, and then gave a House Brackmann grade. Main outcome measure: The 3 systems of grading facial nerve paralysis were evaluated and compared with the use of intraclass correlation coefficients, Pearson's weighted kappa, and percentage exact agreement values. Results: The Sydney and the Sunnybrook systems had good intrasystem reliability and high intersystem association for the assessment of voluntary movement. Grading of synkinesis was found to have low reliability both within and between systems. The House Brackmann system had substantial reliability as shown by weighted kappa but had a percentage exact agreement of 44%. Conclusions: For clinical grading of voluntary movement, there is good correlation between ratings given on the Sydney and Sunnybrook systems, and within each system there is good reliability.

Pub-med,Autogenous fascia lata grafts: clinical applications in reanimation of the totally or partially paralyzed face,"Background: Although they are traditionally reserved for ""aesthetic refinement"" in the latter stages of facial reanimation surgery, the author uses a variety of autogenous fascia lata grafts in a very aggressive approach as the primary therapeutic option in static facial rebalancing and/or in conjunction with dynamic muscle transfers to achieve architectural integrity and functional restoration of the totally or partially paralyzed face. Methods: Forty-nine autogenous fascia lata grafts, harvested through serial incisions in the lateral thigh, were placed in 35 totally or partially paralyzed faces. The grafts were categorized by anatomical location: I and II, lateral lip in totally paralyzed and partially paralyzed faces, respectively; III, nostril suspension; IV, lower eyelid suspension; V, bimalar lower lip sling; and VI, platysma transfer/autogenous fascia lata extension for lower lip invagination. Results: In all group I and II cases, static balance of facial architecture was restored at 4 to 6 weeks (after swelling resolved). Average lip commissure displacement was corrected to within 0.5 cm of the horizontal axis. Subjective functional improvement in speech, fluid retention, and chewing was immediate in all cases. In group I (n = 10; median age, 10.5 years), a 60 to 100 percent symmetrical smile was achieved with voluntary gracilis contraction of 3 of 5 to 5 of 5. In group II (n = 20; median age, 33 years), with 16 sling only patients, one to two grades of voluntary risorius and lip elevator motion were achieved in most. When accompanied by a temporalis turnover flap, both risorius and lip elevator function improved two to three grades. In group III (n = 5), inspiratory collapse was ameliorated in all cases and nasal flow improved subjectively 80 to 100 percent. In group IV (n = 4), scleral show and keratitis were improved in all cases. In group V (n = 6), improved oral competence was achieved in all patients. In group VI (n = 4), static lip evagination was achieved in all cases; voluntary lip depressor function was two to four grades improved. Conclusions: Early placement of autogenous fascia lata restores static balance of the deeper facial architecture in repose. Functional improvement of chewing, fluid retention, speech articulation, smile symmetry, and ectropion is immediate.

Pub-med,Are there ethnic differences of facial movements between Europeans and Asians?,"Purpose: Due to the widespread use of Free Functional Muscle Transplant (FFMT) around the world to reanimate the paralysed face, it is important to be aware of ethnic differences in facial movements. Methods and material: Participants in this study were born in Taiwan (n=24) and Austria (n=24). Analyses were conducted applying the digitised three-dimensional video-analysis system. All 48 subjects have never undergone any treatments in the face nor did they have previous histories of craniofacial anomalies. Results: In general, Europeans were observed to have larger facial movements than Asians, from 0.4 mm (e.g. 5.7%) up to 3.9 mm (e.g. 30.3%), on average 1.3 mm+/-0.82 SD (e.g. 20.6%). Particularly the eyebrow, nose and mouth regions show statistically significant larger excursions on average 1.4 mm (e.g. 19.9%), 1.3 mm (e.g. 34.6%) and 3.0 mm (e.g. 30.3%). One exception is in the eye region, where Asians have a larger excursion (1.4 mm, e.g. 15.8%) of the eyelids, due to the larger distances between the upper and lower eyelids in the rest position. Conclusion: Europeans have generally larger facial movements than Asians. Particularly the eyebrow, nose and mouth regions show statistically significant larger excursions; exception must be made to the eye region, where Asians have a larger excursion of the eyelids.

Patients: Ten patients with facial paralysis from proximal nerve injury underwent the facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with a parotid-release maneuver. Main outcome measures: The Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and photographs. Results: Facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with parotid release was technically feasible in all cases, and anastomosis was performed distal to the origin of the ansa hypoglossi. All patients had good return of facial nerve function. Nine patients had scores of C or better, indicating strong eyelid and oral sphincter closure and mass motion. There was no hemilingual atrophy and no subjective tongue dysfunction. Conclusions: The parotid-release maneuver mobilizes additional length to the facial nerve, facilitating a tensionless communication distal to the ansa hypoglossi. The technique is a viable option for facial reanimation, and our patients achieved good clinical outcomes with continual improvement.",3,,0,0,2,1,9,1,0,10.1055/s-2006-934111,Skull Base. 2006 May;16(2):101-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2006-934111.,"Roland JT Jr, Lin K, Klausner LM, Miller PJ.",2006,17077874,"The Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaire,facial stiffness and eye dryness",10,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,

Pub-med,Intratemporal facial nerve transfer with direct coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve,"Objective: To evaluate functional recovery after facial-hypoglossal nerve transfer with direct coaptation of the intratemporal part of the facial nerve. Study design: Retrospective study. Setting: University-based tertiary referral center. Patients: Nine patients who underwent facial-hypoglossal transfer surgery between 2001 and 2006 to treat a unilateral complete facial nerve palsy. Intervention: The facial nerve is mobilized in the temporal bone, transsected at the second genu, transferred and directly coaptated to a partially incised hypoglossal nerve. Main outcome measures: The House-Brackmann grading system was used to evaluate facial nerve reinnervation. Tongue atrophy and movements were documented. Quality of life related to facial function was assessed using the validated Facial Disability Index. Results: A House-Brackmann Grade III (86%) was achieved in six patients, and Grade IV (14%) in one patient with an average follow-up of 22 months (range, 12-48 mo). Two patients had a follow-up of less than 12 months after surgery, and reinnervation was still in progress. In none of the patients who were operated on was tongue atrophy or impaired movement observed. Postoperative Facial Disability Index scores (mean, 71.8 +/- standard deviation [SD] 10.6) for physical functioning and social functioning (mean, 85.7 +/- SD 9.8) were increased for all patients when compared with preoperative scores (mean, 28.6 +/- SD 9.0; mean, 37.7 +/- SD 14.4, respectively). Conclusion: The facial-hypoglossal nerve transfer with direct coaptation of the intratemporal part of the facial nerve offers good functional results with low lingual morbidity and improved quality of life.

Pub-med,A simple reconstruction for congenital unilateral lower lip palsy,"Background: Congenital unilateral lower lip palsy or congenital hypoplasia of the depressor anguli oris muscle, also known as asymmetric crying facies, characterized by deformity of the lower lip, lacks aggressive surgical intervention methods. Although several dynamic and static reconstruction methods have been reported, textbooks introduce only passive surgical intervention, of weakening the unaffected side through techniques such as selective marginal mandibular neurectomy which, however, tends to produce lack of emotive movement. Therefore, a new surgical intervention for the reconstructive treatment of asymmetric crying facies is presented. Methods: A bidirectional (horizontal and vertical) fascia was grafted to restore the aesthetic appearance of the asymmetric lower lip. The horizontal fascial strip achieves restoration of the center of the lower lip to its proper position, whereas the vertical fascial strip achieves aesthetic symmetry of the lower lip at mouth opening. Each end of the vertical strip is anchored to the lower lip and the mandibular bone, respectively, thereby allowing simultaneous movement of the mandible and lower lip. Results: The reconstruction of unilateral lower lip palsy has been successfully performed on seven patients, with ages ranging from 2 years 9 months to 11 years 1 month, since June of 1996. Conclusions: The aim of this procedure is not to achieve complete dynamic reanimation. However, with regard to its simplicity and minimal invasiveness and the satisfaction of the patients, it is considered to be a well-balanced surgical intervention.",0,,0,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1097/01.prs.0000264062.64251.10,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2007 Jul;120(1):238-244. doi: 10.1097/01.prs.0000264062.64251.10.,"Udagawa A, Arikawa K, Shimizu S, Suzuki H, Matsumoto H, Yoshimoto S, Ichinose M.",2007,17572570,"Tools: clinical evaluation Outcomes: restoration of lower lip, symmetry fascial graft",7,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Temporalis tendon transfer as part of a comprehensive approach to facial reanimation,"Objective: To report an approach to facial paralysis in patients for whom dynamic adjacent muscle transfer is determined to be the best treatment option. Methods: Retrospective review of 7 consecutive patients who underwent orthodromic transfer of the temporalis muscle insertion for the treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. Patients underwent facial-retraining physical therapy before and shortly after the procedure. Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, objective measurements of oral commissure elevation with smiling, and physician grading of preoperative and postoperative patient photographs. Medical records were reviewed for complications. Results: Patient satisfaction was high, with a mean score of 8.5 (possible score of 10). Four patients were physician graded as excellent to superb. The other 3 patients were rated as having good postoperative results. Movement was identified in every patient and ranged from 1.6 to 8.5 mm, with mean movement of the oral commissure of 4.2 mm. One patient developed postoperative salivary fluid collection that required drainage. Conclusions: Temporalis tendon transfer is a relatively easy procedure to perform that has distinct advantages compared with other forms of facial reanimation and provides very good results. This procedure results in improved form and function, may often be performed in a minimally invasive manner, and eliminates the facial asymmetry typically produced by temporalis transfer.",0,,0,3,10,9,8,3,0,10.1001/archfaci.9.4.234,Arch Facial Plast Surg. 2007 Jul-Aug;9(4):234-41. doi: 10.1001/archfaci.9.4.234.,"Byrne PJ, Kim M, Boahene K, Millar J, Moe K.",2007,17638756,"Tools: self-evaluation of results by the patients, mesaurements of oral commissure Positive Outcomes: movement, patient satisfaction temporalis tendon transfer Negative Outcomes: postoperative salivary fluid collection",7,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Customized gold weight eyelid implantation in paralytic lagophthalmos,"Gold eyelid implantation is widely considered the procedure of choice to reanimate the upper eyelid in paralytic lagophthalmos. Commercially supplied implants are not readily available in all places and are sometimes cumbersome to import. Objective: We aimed to devise a method whereby every surgeon performing gold eyelid implantation could have easy and quick access to the implant. Furthermore, we aimed to develop a means of creating an implant of the exact weight required for complete eyelid closure. Study design and setting: A prospective study was performed from 1997 to 2005 in a tertiary research hospital, involving 50 subjects requiring gold upper eyelid implantation and using the technique in question. Results: Only patients with a minimum follow up of one year were included in the study group. Symptoms improved in 96 per cent of subjects, who were able to dispense with eyedrops and eye ointments. Visual acuity improved in 92 per cent of patients. There were two extrusions amongst the early cases.

Pub-med,Three-dimensional video analysis of the paralyzed face reanimated by cross-face nerve grafting and free gracilis muscle transplantation: quantification of the functional outcome,"Background: Surgeons have found it difficult to quantify facial paralysis and its improvement by reconstructive surgery. This article presents the results achieved by free functional muscle transplantation for reconstruction of the paralyzed face, registered by three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements. Methods: Of patients treated consecutively between 1997 and 2006, two groups were constituted: group 1 comprised 22 patients with reinnervation completed after a single cross-face nerve graft and a free gracilis muscle graft for reconstruction of the smile; group 2 comprised nine patients treated with two cross-face nerve grafts followed by a territorially differentiated gracilis muscle transplant for reconstruction of the smile and eye closure. Smiling with showing teeth, maximal showing of teeth, and closing the eyes as in sleep were analyzed in detail. Results: In group 1, static asymmetry was reduced from 12.19 +/- 8.73 mm preoperatively to -1.84 +/- 7.67 mm at 18 months postoperatively. Smile amplitude increased from 9 to 60 percent of that on the healthy side in 10 incomplete facial palsies of this group, and from 0 to 62 percent in eight functionally successful muscle grafts among 11 patients with complete lesions. In group 2, static asymmetry improved from 7.24 +/- 12.64 mm to -5.36 +/- 9.07 mm; the overcorrection was intentional. Movement was improved in eight cases. Smile amplitude reached 68 +/- 43 percent of that on the normal side. Lagophthalmus improved from 7.21 +/- 3.59 mm to 1.38 +/- 2.49 mm. All improvements were statistically significant (p <or= 0.05). Conclusions: Three-dimensional video analysis provided an exact quantitative documentation of the degree of facial palsy preoperatively and the reconstructed movements.

Pub-med,Single-incision endoscopic sural nerve harvest for cross face nerve grafting,"Cross face nerve grafting followed by free muscle transfer has become a standard of care in rehabilitation of the paralyzed face. In an effort to address the surgical morbidity of sural nerve harvest, multiple groups have attempted to minimize lower extremity trauma from sural nerve harvest. In very preliminary studies, investigators have adapted the use of vein harvesting equipment for harvest of the sural nerve. In this article we describe the use of endoscopic vein harvesting equipment for sural nerve harvest in a series of eight patients undergoing facial reanimation, in which a single distal incision is made posterior to the lateral malleolus. Eight patients presented for first-stage cross face nerve grafting for facial reanimation over a 6-month period. Each patient was operated on using a two-team approach. One team exposed the donor branches of the facial nerve on the healthy side while the endoscopic harvest was simultaneously executed in the lower limb by the second team. In each case, the sural nerve graft > 20 cm in length was removed through a single 1.5-cm incision. There were no complications. Operative times decreased steadily throughout the period examined and were < 20 minutes for the last two patients. For the final two cases, a modified sural nerve stripper was introduced through the instrument portal of the VasoView device (Guidant Co., Natick, MA), which contained a small notch through which the nerve could be threaded, greatly facilitating dissection. This contributed to decreasing operative times. Thus we combined the technological advances of a sophisticated endoscopic system with our minimally invasive nerve stripper technique to improve sural nerve harvest. We found no increased morbidity from the endoscopic approach, and in all cases we were able to remove the nerve through a single incision. The endoscopic sural nerve harvest is an excellent addition to the armamentarium of the facial reanimation surgeon.",5,,2,3,0,5,8,2,0,10.1055/s-0028-1088235,J Reconstr Microsurg. 2008 Oct;24(7):519-23. doi: 10.1055/s-0028-1088235.

Pub-med,Free tissue transfer for the treatment of facial paralysis,"Long-standing facial paralysis requires the introduction of viable, innervated dynamic muscle to restore facial movement. The options include regional muscle transfer and microvascular free tissue transfer. There are advantages and disadvantages of each. Briefly, the regional muscle transfer procedures are reliable and provide immediate return of movement. However, the movement is not of a spontaneous mimetic nature. Free tissue transfer, in contrast, offers the possibility of synchronous, mimetic movement. It does, however, require a prolonged healing time in comparison with that of regional muscle transfer. The choice is made by physician and patient together, taking into account their preferences and biases. Muscle-alone free tissue transfer is our preferred option for reanimation of uncomplicated facial paralysis without skin or soft tissue deficits. Combined muscle and other tissue (most are skin flap) is another preferred option for more challenging complex facial paralysis with skin or soft tissue deficits after tumor excision. Gracilis flap is the author's first choice of muscle transplantation for both reconstructions. From 1986 to 2006, gracilis functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) was performed at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital for facial reanimation in 249 cases of facial paralysis. The main etiology is postoperative complication and Bell's palsy. The innervating nerve comes mostly from contralateral facial nerve branches, few from ipsilateral facial nerve due to tumor ablation, and from ipsilateral motor branch to masseter or spinal accessory nerve due to M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome. We have evolutionally used a short nerve graft (10 to 15 cm) to cross the face in the first stage; after a 6- to 9-month waiting period, gracilis FFMT was performed for the second stage of the reconstruction.

Pub-med,Hemihypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy after mastoid dissection of the facial nerve: results in 24 patients and comparison with the classic technique,"Objective: Hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy has been widely used for reanimation of paralyzed facial muscles after irreversible proximal injury of the facial nerve. However, complete section of the hypoglossal nerve occasionally results in hemiglossal dysfunction and interferes with swallowing and speech. To reduce this morbidity, a modified technique with partial section of the hypoglossal nerve after mastoid dissection of the facial nerve (HFM) has been used. We report our experience with the HFM technique, retrospectively comparing the outcome with results of the classic hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy. Methods: A retrospective review was performed in 36 patients who underwent hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with the classic (n = 12) or variant technique (n = 24) between 2000 and 2006. Facial outcome was evaluated with the House-Brackmann grading system, and tongue function was evaluated with a new scale proposed to quantify postoperative tongue alteration. The results were compared, and age and time between nerve injury and surgery were correlated with the outcome. Results: There was no significant difference between the two techniques concerning facial reanimation. A worse outcome of tongue function, however, was associated with the classic technique (Mann-Whitney U test; P < 0.05). When HFM was used, significant correlations defined by the Spearman test were identified between preoperative delay (rho = 0.59; P = 0.002) or age (rho = 0.42; P = 0.031) and results of facial reanimation evaluated with the House-Brackmann grading system. Conclusion: HFM is as effective as classic hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy for facial reanimation, and it has a much lower morbidity related to tongue function. Better results are obtained in younger patients and with a shorter interval between facial nerve injury and surgery.",3,,0,0,5,9,2,1,0,10.1227/01.NEU.0000312387.52508.2C,Neurosurgery. 2008 Aug;63(2):310-6; discussion 317. doi: 10.1227/01.NEU.0000312387.52508.2C.,"Martins RS, Socolovsky M, Siqueira MG, Campero A.",2008,18797361,,36,,,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,Retrospective outcome analysis of temporalis muscle transfer for the treatment of paralytic lagophthalmos,"Temporalis muscle transfer for paralytic lagophthalmos, which was first proposed by Gillies and later developed by Andersen, has been one of the most common treatment modalities for paralytic lagophthalmos. However, there have been no scientific reports statistically analysing the efficacy of temporalis muscle transfer. We, therefore, retrospectively analysed the functional and aesthetic results of temporalis muscle transfer. Between 1994 and 2006, we carried out temporalis muscle transfer (the so-called Gillies-Andersen method) on 95 established facial paralysis patients. We sent a postal questionnaire to these patients and 47 of them responded. The functional and aesthetic results were analysed based on the patients' replies together with clinical records and photographs, and unfavourable factors of this procedure were investigated. After surgery, most ocular symptoms (mechanical irritation, dry eye, soreness, and discharge) improved significantly. Achievement rate of complete eye closure was 78.7%. A morphometric study revealed that possible unfavourable factors (old age, intracranial disease, use of dentures, etc.) did not affect the achievement rates of complete eye closure. Deformity of eyelid fissure due to undue tension of the temporal fascia fixation was found in nine patients (19.1%) and six of these patients underwent secondary revision. Unlike lid loading with a gold implant, the results of temporalis muscle transfer depend greatly on the surgeon's skill. However, if this procedure is performed properly, strong eye closure can be obtained. We, therefore, recommend temporalis muscle transfer as the preferred option for reconstruction of paralytic lagophthalmos. ¬¨¬© 2008 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.",0,,0,1,10,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2007.12.081,"Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (2009) 62:9 (1187-1195).

Pub-med,Bilateral simultaneous free gracilis muscle transfer: a realistic option in management of bilateral facial paralysis,"Objectives: Bilateral facial paralysis patients have oral incompetence, poor articulation, and dental caries. This problem is frequently addressed by performing staged gracilis transplants without specific oral sphincter reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to describe the technique of bilateral simultaneous free gracilis muscle transfer with oral sphincter reconstruction, for one-stage facial reanimation in patients with bilateral facial paralysis. Study design: Case series. Methods/results: One-stage bilateral gracilis transfer was performed in three patients with bilateral facial paralysis. Muscle transplants produced a meaningful smile in all transferred muscles. All patients reported improved speech and decreased drooling. Conclusions: Bilateral gracilis transplants with reconstruction of the oral commissure is a realistic option in management of the bilaterally paralyzed face. In this small series, it appears to improve oral competence, restore smiling, and contribute favorably to lower lip support. This technique has been made more feasible because the operative time for free tissue transfer has continuously declined with the use of two-team surgery, improved microsurgical techniques, and the advent of venous coupling devices.",0,,1,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.otohns.2009.03.005,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2009 Jul;141(1):139-41. doi: 10.1016/j.otohns.2009.03.005.,"Lindsay RW, Hadlock TA, Cheney ML.",2009,19559974,"Tools: clinical evaluation Outcomes: smile, oral competence, lower lip support",3,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Outcomes of direct muscle neurotization in pediatric patients with facial paralysis,"Background: Multistage reconstructive procedures are often required to try to restore the emotional potential of human expression in cases of facial paralysis. In this study, the senior author's (J.K.T.) experience with the technique of direct nerve to muscle neurotization as a part of multistage facial reanimation procedures is presented. Age, denervation time, etiology of the lesion, previous reconstructive procedures, and types of muscles responsible for animation were analyzed to make evidence-based recommendations on the indications of the technique as well as its role and effectiveness in facial reanimation. Methods: Retrospective review of 37 pediatric patients who underwent direct muscle neurotization took place. The patients were divided into three groups, depending on the region that direct neurotization was aiming to augment. Group A involved 28 patients for eye closure and blink, group B included 15 patients for smile, and group C included 19 patients for depressor augmentation. Results: Twenty patients were female and 17 male. Patient age ranged from 1 to 16 years, with a mean age (+/-SD) of 9 +/- 2.8 years. Denervation time ranged from 3 months to 15.25 years, and the mean denervation time was 6.72 years. Electromyographic scoring of the neurotized muscles showed an overall mean improvement of 36 percent for eye closure, 34.25 percent for blink, 37 percent for smile augmentation, and 30 percent for depressor function restoration.

Pub-med,Effect of axonal load on the functional and aesthetic outcomes of the cross-facial nerve graft procedure for facial reanimation,"Background: To improve the ability to prognosticate the final surgery outcomes, this study was carried out to explore the correlation between the number of motor axons given to cross-facial nerve grafts for smile restoration and the aesthetic and functional outcomes. Methods: Sixty-nine cases had adequate nerve biopsy specimens and were selected for the authors' study. Patient information was collected from chart review. Using Terzis' evaluation scale, smile functional and aesthetic outcomes as depicted in standardized videos were graded by a panel of four independent reviewers. Digital images of nerve specimens in stages I and II were obtained by using a microscope with a digital camera attachment. Using MetaMorph software, the number of motor axons was calculated, with the exception of the nerve specimens at the distal nerve grafts in stage II, which were quantitated manually. Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests were used to test the effects of axon numbers and other factors on the outcomes. Results: The donor axonal input correlated with the axon number at the distal end of the nerve graft and also correlated with the improvement of evaluation; however, no significance was found between the counts at the distal end of the nerve graft and the clinical outcomes. An important observation was that patients with a donor nerve count of 900 or higher showed a greater likelihood of achieving satisfactory results.

Pub-med,Outcomes of mini-hypoglossal nerve transfer and direct muscle neurotization for restoration of lower lip function in facial palsy,"Background: Most reconstructions for lower lip palsy focus on paralyzing the contralateral normal lip or providing static support on the affected side. The authors' unit has reported dynamic strategies for lower lip reanimation and use of 40 percent of the hypoglossal nerve (mini-hypoglossal) in facial reanimation. They report their experience with mini-hypoglossal nerve transfer for lower lip palsy. Methods: Between 1987 and 2005, 29 patients with unilateral facial palsy had lower lip reanimation with the mini-hypoglossal as the motor donor. Twenty patients had transfer of the mini-hypoglossal to the cervicofacial branch of the facial nerve and nine had direct depressor muscle neurotization. Five patients had a mean denervation time of 14.60 +/- 4.50 months (<2 years), and the rest had a mean denervation time of 10.63 +/- 9.23 years. In late cases, the facial nerve was in-continuity, and preoperative needle electromyographs of depressors showed at least fibrillations. Standardized videos taken preoperatively and at 2 years postoperatively were available for 27 patients and assessed by three independent reviewers. Needle electromyographic results were analyzed. Results: Thirteen patients (48.15 percent) achieved excellent and good results, nine (33.33 percent) had moderate results, and five (18.52 percent) obtained fair results. The difference between the averaged preoperative and postoperative scores was statistically significant, as was the difference in electromyographic outcomes (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

Pub-med,Botulinum toxin injection in long-standing facial paralysis patients: improvement of facial symmetry observed up to 6 months,"Background: Despite modern reanimation surgical techniques, facial paralysis presents with functional and aesthetic deficits. We evaluated facial symmetry after treating with botulinum toxin the healthy side of the face of 25 patients with long-standing facial paralysis who had previously been treated by surgical methods, with 6 months follow-up. Methods: Evaluation consisted of a clinical score, the two subscales of the Facial Disability Index, and surface electromyography. The mean botulinum toxin dose was 38 +/- 5 U (range = 15-69 U). Results: The clinical score showed significant reduction of asymmetry of 48.4% at 1 month and 16.8% after 6 months. The initial result was a consequence of reduced motion on the treated side combined with better motion on the paralyzed side. At 6 months, the treated side returned to basal scores. The residual effect seen in symmetry was due to an increase (18%) of motion in the paralyzed side. There was a significant decrease in the action potential of muscles on the nonparalyzed side 1 month post injection but completely reverted after 6 months. The Physical Function Index increased, but not significantly. The Social/Well-Being Function Index showed a significant increase at 6 months compared to pretreatment. Conclusion: The proposed treatment improved facial symmetry for up to 6 months. Even after the end of the clinical effect of the drug, the paralyzed side's clinical score was 18% higher than pretreatment, with an increased quality of life.",0,,0,0,0,9,8,1,1,10.1007/s00266-009-9337-9,Aesthetic Plast Surg. 2009 Jul;33(4):582-90. doi: 10.1007/s00266-009-9337-9.

Pub-med,"The ""babysitter"" procedure: minihypoglossal to facial nerve transfer and cross-facial nerve grafting","Background: In 1984, Terzis introduced the ""babysitter"" procedure, a new concept in facial reanimation. It involves two stages, with coaptation of ipsilateral 40 percent hypoglossal to facial nerve on the affected side, performed concomitantly with cross-facial nerve grafting and secondary microcoaptations 8 to 15 months later. This article presents the senior author's (J.K.T.) experience with the original procedure. Methods: Of 75 patients who had minihypoglossal nerve transfer, 20 fulfilled the selection criteria for the original babysitter procedure. All patients' records, photographs, videotapes, and needle electromyography studies were reviewed. The clinical results were scored using Terzis' Grading Scale. Eye closure, smile, and lower lip depression were each assessed separately. Functional and aesthetic outcomes and preoperative and postoperative electromyography results were analyzed. Results: Seventy-five percent of patients achieved excellent and good results, 15 percent had moderate results, and 10 percent had fair results. The difference between preoperative and postoperative eye closure was statistically significant (t test, p < 0.001). Symmetrical smile and full contraction (excellent result) was achieved in two patients (10 percent), 13 patients (65 percent) had nearly symmetrical smile (good result), and five patients (25 percent) had a moderate result. Two patients (10 percent) had full lower lip depression (excellent result) and 15 (75 percent) had good results. In three patients (15 percent), subsequent digastric or platysma muscle transfer was performed because of inadequate depression and symmetry (moderate result). A statistically significant difference was observed between preoperative and postoperative electromyography results, in eye closure, smile, and lower lip depression. Conclusions: The original babysitter procedure offers significant improvement in selected patients with facial paralysis. Symmetry and coordinated movements can be restored, with satisfying aesthetic and functional outcomes.",4,,2,1,0,9,6,2,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e31819ba4bb,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2009 Mar;123(3):865-876. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0b013e31819ba4bb.,"Terzis JK, Tzafetta K.",2009,19319050,,20,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:cross-facial,hypoglossal",,Cross-facial nerve transfer,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,['Platysma flap'],Platysma flap,,
Pub-med,Secondary surgery in adult facial paralysis reanimation,"Background: The series presented constitutes the entire experience with adult facial paralysis reanimation by a single surgeon over three decades. This report discusses the different reconstructive strategies used in this sample, focusing on the incidence and outcomes of commonly used revisional and ancillary procedures. Methods: Since 1979, 175 adult cases of facial paralysis underwent facial reanimation surgery performed by the senior author (J.K.T.). The reconstructive strategies varied in accordance with denervation time, cause, and whether the paralysis was complete or partial and unilateral or bilateral. Irrespective of these variables, the number of patients who required secondary surgery totaled 141 of 175 (81 percent). Postrevision videos were available in 122 patients, who constituted the sample evaluated. Four independent observers rated the outcomes of secondary surgery using a five-category scale ranging from poor to excellent. Results: Interrater reliability testing showed Cronbach's alpha values above acceptable limits (alpha > 0.80). The effect of diverse revisional and ancillary interventions was measured computing a mean gain percentage score. Secondary surgery yielded a significant upgrade in symmetry and function, with appreciable improvements in all three facial regions (upper face, 28 to 166 percent gain; miDFace, 33 to 72 percent gain; and lower face, 20 to 127 percent gain). Conclusions: This comprehensive analysis of the entire series of adult reanimation in the authors' center evidences the beneficial effects of revisional and ancillary interventions to augment function and overall symmetry. Inherent in all methods of dynamic reanimation is the need for secondary adjustments, which should be considered in most cases, as they can transform an adequate result into a gratifying outcome.",0,,0,0,10,7,4,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181bcee62,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2009 Dec;124(6):1916-1931. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181bcee62.,"Terzis JK, Olivares FS.",2009,19952647,"Negative Outcome: remoal of weight impact, bulking of cheek",141,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,The phrenic nerve as a motor nerve donor for facial reanimation with the free latissimus dorsi muscle,"Free functional muscle transfer for acquired facial paralysis most often involves two stages. In this report, we describe single-stage free muscle transfer using the phrenic nerve as the donor motor nerve. Six patients with unilateral facial paralysis underwent single-stage facial reanimation using a free latissimus dorsi muscle with the ipsilateral phrenic nerve as the donor nerve. These cases were retrospectively studied to review technique and to determine outcomes including time to muscle reinnervation, patient satisfaction, smile symmetry, and complications. The mean age was 33 years. Five patients had complete unilateral facial paralysis and one had incomplete. There was no flap loss. The transferred muscle demonstrated active contraction in all patients at a mean of 14 weeks postoperatively (range, 12 to 16 weeks). Good dynamic symmetry was achieved by 6 to 9 months in all patients. All patients underwent rehabilitation including nerve reeducation. No clinically significant pulmonary morbidity was observed after the unilateral transection of the phrenic nerve. Using the phrenic nerve in free muscle transfer for facial paralysis allows a single-stage procedure with no requirement for nerve grafting and a rapid reinnervation time, shortening the time required for restoring facial animation.",4,,2,1,10,9,4,1,0,10.1055/s-0029-1223851,J Reconstr Microsurg. 2009 Nov;25(8):457-63. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1223851.

Pub-med,Palpebral spring in the management of lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy secondary to facial nerve palsy,"Purpose: To evaluate the use of a palpebral spring, a dynamic facial reanimation technique, in the management of lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy secondary to facial nerve palsy. Methods: A palpebral spring was placed in 29 eyelids of 28 patients with symptomatic facial nerve palsy. Preoperative and postoperative symptoms, upper eyelid margin to midpupil distance, lagophthalmos, and exposure keratopathy were evaluated. Results: At an average of 83 months follow-up, preoperative symptoms improved or resolved in 26 (90%) eyes. The upper eyelid margin to midpupil distance decreased and lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy significantly improved after palpebral spring placement (p < 0.001). After modification of the technique by suturing the spring to the anterior tarsal surface, rather than encasing the tip in a silicone tube and letting it ride freely, tension of the spring required adjustment in 4 eyes (27%). Dislocation of the spring from the tarsus without exposure through the skin was observed in 1 eyelid (7%). The spring was replaced because of loss of function secondary to metal fatigue in 5 eyelids (33%) after an average of 43 months. Exposure of the spring through the skin was observed in 2 eyelids (14%) and required spring removal from 1 eyelid and replacement of the spring in the other. Conclusion: A palpebral spring is an effective treatment for lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy in patients with facial nerve palsy who do not receive adequate relief from the static procedures of lower eyelid tightening and upper eyelid lowering. This technique significantly improved symptoms and signs in these patients while allowing some of the blink reflex.",0,,0,0,10,7,8,3,0,10.1097/IOP.0b013e3181ab6f08,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 2009 Jul-Aug;25(4):270-5. doi: 10.1097/IOP.0b013e3181ab6f08.,"Demirci H, Frueh BR.",2009,19617783,neg: Symptomatic lagophthalmos,28,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Dual innervation method using one-stage reconstruction with free latissimus dorsi muscle transfer for re-animation of established facial paralysis: simultaneous reinnervation of the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve and the contralateral facial nerve to improve the quality of smile and emotional facial expressions,"Background: One-stage microneurovascular free muscle transfer is a common surgical procedure for re-animation of established facial paralysis. However, innervation of the transferred muscle by the contralateral facial nerve prevents smile and other facial expressions on one side, and reinnervation requires about 7 months. To overcome these drawbacks, we report a dual innervation method using one-stage reconstruction with free latissimus dorsi muscle transfer. Methods: Three patients were treated with the dual innervation method, which is based on the one-stage method with some modifications: the soft tissue present over the ipsilateral masseter muscle and the hilum where the thoracodorsal nerve proceeds into the muscle segment is removed; the muscle is harvested to locate the hilum in the cranial one-third of the segment; and the muscle is transferred to the malar pocket of the paralysed face such that the hilum contacts the masseter muscle. Results: On average, muscle movement was recognised on voluntary biting at 3.4 months and on spontaneous smiling at 5.9 months after surgery. A dual innervation sign was recorded on electromyographs 6.4 months after surgery. The patients developed a spontaneous symmetrical smile and facial expressions on one side with minimum synkinesis after postoperative mirror rehabilitation. Conclusions: The advantages of the dual innervation method include faster reinnervation of the transferred muscle compared to one-stage options; achievement of spontaneous smile and voluntary smile on each side; augmentation of neural signals to the muscle for more symmetrical smiling; minimum synkinesis of the transferred muscle on biting for eyelid closure and emotional facial re-animation through a learning program to enhance cerebral cortical reorganisation.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,2,1,1,9,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2008.07.025,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2009 Dec;62(12):1589-97. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2008.07.025.

Embase,Total parotidectomy defect reconstruction using the buried free flap,"Objective 1) Present an alternative method of total parotidectomy with or without neck dissection defect reconstruction that results in improved cosmesis. 2) Describe applications of free tissue transfer in parotidectomy defect reconstruction. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Two tertiary-care medical centers. Subjects and Methods A two-institution retrospective review from 2002 to 2009 was conducted for buried free flaps utilized in reconstruction of defects from total parotidectomy with or without neck dissection. Patients with temporal bone or skin resections were excluded. Demographic information, tumor characteristics, surgical interventions, flap details, and adjunctive facial reconstructive techniques were recorded. Postoperative cosmetic results were evaluated by patient and physician satisfaction. Results Eighteen patients with a mean age of 57.4 years underwent flap reconstruction. Total parotidectomy was performed in all cases, 11 cases required facial nerve sacrifice, and 14 cases included neck dissection. The anterolateral thigh flap was the most often utilized free flap. Mean flap area was 65.5 cm(2). Adjunctive static facial reanimation was employed in eight patients. All flaps survived. Ten patients underwent adjuvant radiation. Free flap reconstruction resulted in cosmetic patient and surgeon satisfaction, despite adjuvant radiation therapy. Conclusion Free flap reconstruction of total parotidectomy (with or without neck dissection) defects is safe and effective. It does not preclude adjunctive facial reanimation and provides sufficient tissue bulk to match the contralateral facial contour despite radical resections and adjuvant radiation therapy in most cases. ¬¨¬© 2010 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.",0,,2,0,5,4,4,1,0,10.1016/j.otohns.2010.08.014,Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (2010) 143:5 (637-643).

Embase,Reanimation of reversible facial paralysis by the double innervation technique using an intraneural-dissected sural nerve graft,"In treating reversible facial paralysis, cross-facial nerve grafting offers voluntary and emotional reanimation. In contrast, rapid re-innervation and strong neural stimulation can be obtained with hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover. In this article, we describe the method of a combination of these techniques as a one-stage procedure. A 39-year-old man presented with facial paralysis due to nerve avulsion within the stylomastoid foramen. The sural nerve was harvested and two branches were created at its distal end by intraneural dissection. One branch was anastomosed to the contralateral facial nerve, and the other branch was used for hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover, followed by connecting the proximal stump of the graft to the trunk of the paralysed facial nerve in an end-to-end fashion. At 9 months postoperatively, almost complete facial symmetry and co-ordinated movements of the mimetic muscles were obtained with no obvious tongue atrophy. Since our method can efficiently gather neural inputs from the contralateral facial nerve and the ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve, it may become a good alternative for reanimation of reversible facial paralysis when the ipsilateral facial nerve is not available. ¬¨¬© 2009 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.",6,Hypoglossal + CFNG ,0,2,0,9,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2009.11.023,"Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (2010) 63:6 (e535-e539).

Embase,Facial reanimation with end-to-end hypoglossofacial anastomosis: 20 years experience,"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate retrospectively the results of experience with end-to-end anastomosis of cranial nerves VII and XII, performed due to transection of the facial nerve during acoustic neuroma removal.Methods: We assessed the facial reanimation results of 33 patients whose facial nerves had been transected during acoustic neuroma excision via a retrosigmoid approach, between 1985 and 2006, and who underwent end-to-end hypoglossofacial anastomosis. We compared the facial nerve functions of patients receiving short term (two to three years) and long term (more than three years) follow up, and we assessed any complications of the anastomosis.Results: A House-Brackmann grade III facial function was achieved in 46.2 and 86.4 per cent of the patients in the short and long term, respectively. HouseBrackmann grade IV facial function was achieved in 53.8 and 13.6 per cent of the patients in the short and long term, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the facial recovery results, comparing the short and long term follow-up periods (p=0.03). Disarticulation was the most common complication, seen in 19 (57.6 per cent) patients; numbness of the tongue was the next commonest (10 (30.3 per cent) patients). None of the patients developed dysphagia.Conclusion: Despite such morbidities as disarticulation and tongue numbness, end-to-end hypoglossofacial anastomosis is still an effective procedure for the surgical rehabilitation of static and dynamic facial nerve functions.

Pub-med,Revisiting orthodromic temporalis transfer in treating long-standing facial paralysis,"The treatment of long-standing facial paralysis through temporalis muscle transfer has stood the test of time. Herein, we present a modification in temporalis muscle transfer for lower facial reanimation. Instead of the traditional stripping of the temporalis muscle from its origin, its insertion is stripped from the coronoid process through an intraoral approach. The detached fibers were then sutured to a fascia lata graft, which was passed and secured to the orbicularis oris to reanimate the corner of the mouth. The procedure is less extensive and provides a direct ""orthodromic"" line of pull with good muscular excursion and power. This simple procedure has been applied to 12 consecutive cases with long-standing complete facial paralysis presenting to the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Clinic at the Ain-Shams University Hospital over the past 2 years. In addition to symmetry at rest, this easy procedure allowed for good movement of the corner of the mouth with restoration of a balanced smile.",0,,2,3,0,9,4,1,0,10.1055/s-0030-1249370,Craniomaxillofac Trauma Reconstr. 2010 Mar;3(1):17-23. doi: 10.1055/s-0030-1249370.,"Elbarbary AS, Hemeda M, Amr AH.",2010,22110814,"Tools: clinical evaluation  Outcomes: pt. satisfaction, physician graded, facial movement, oral commissure,",12,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,['Fascia flap'],Fascia lata ,,
Pub-med,Blink restoration in adult facial paralysis,"Background: Impaired eyelid function in facial paralysis patients is a serious disability that can even threaten vision. Eye reanimation techniques and specifically blink restoration reinstates the cornea's protective mechanism and recovers a more natural appearance and eye function. Both dynamic and static procedures have been used to augment eye closure, but only dynamic procedures can lead to blink restoration. In this study, the experience of a single surgeon (J.K.T.) with dynamic procedures addressing the challenge of blink restoration is presented. Methods: A retrospective review of 95 adult patients who underwent dynamic procedures for blink restoration was performed. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 75) included patients who underwent nerve transfers, including cross-facial nerve grafting and subsequent microcoaptations, mini-hypoglossal nerve transfers, and direct orbicularis oculi muscle neurotization. Group B (n = 20) included patients who underwent eye sphincter substitution procedures, including pedicled frontalis or mini-temporalis transfers, free platysma, occipitalis, gracilis subunits, extensor digitorum brevis, and a slip of adductor longus transfer. Objective blink ratios were measured according to a protocol established by the senior author (J.K.T.). Results: The patients included 34 men and 61 women. Mean age was 34.9 +/- 9.8 years. Denervation time ranged from 7 months to 42.12 years, and the mean denervation time was 13.02 years. Blink improvement was noted in all of the patients.

The ages of the patients ranged from 5 to 63 years (mean: 44.1 years), and 8 (80%) of the patients were females. The duration of paralysis was no longer than 18 months (mean: 9.7 months). Follow-up varied from 6 to 18 months (mean: 12.6 months). Initial voluntary facial movements were observed between 3 and 6 months postoperatively (mean: 4.3 months). All patients were able to produce the appearance of a smile when asked to clench their teeth. Comparing the definition of the nasolabial fold and the degree of movement of the modiolus on both sides of the face, the voluntary smile was considered symmetrical in 8 cases. Recovery of the capacity to blink spontaneously was not observed. However, 8 patients were able to reduce or suspend the application of artificial tears.

Pub-med,Facial animation in patients with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes,"Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of varying severity, involves multiple cranial nerves and is characterised predominantly by bilateral or unilateral paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves. Facial paralysis causes inability to smile and bilabial incompetence with speech difficulties, oral incompetence, problems with eating and drinking, including pocketing of food in the cheek and dribbling, as well as severe drooling. Other relevant clinical findings are incomplete eye closure and convergent strabismus.

Pub-med,The incidence of anterior belly of digastric agenesis in patients with hemifacial microsomia,"Background: : The study examined the incidence of anterior belly of digastric muscle agenesis in patients with hemifacial microsomia, to determine the need for routine imaging of the floor of the mouth in patients within this group requesting dynamic lower lip reanimation. Methods: : Patients presenting with microtia were assessed according to the OMENS [orbital deformity, mandibular hypoplasia, ear deformity, nerve (cranialnerve VII) involvement, and soft-tissue deficiency] criteria, and also imaged to establish the presence or absence of the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Each affected hemiface was treated as an individual case (n = 50), with unaffected hemifaces being assigned as controls (an additional group of unaffected controls were also included). The hemifaces with microtia were then subdivided into three groups: those with isolated microtia (with anterior belly of the digastric muscle present), those with features consistent with hemifacial microsomia (with the anterior belly of the digastric muscle present), and those with absent anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Results: : Anterior belly of the digastric muscle agenesis rate was 40 percent in those patients displaying features consistent with hemifacial microsomia. Median OMENS scores were significantly different in intergroup analysis (p < 0.0001), with a trend noticed between the median value for the hemifacial microsomia group and those with absent anterior belly of the digastric muscle. There were no noted incidences of anterior belly of the digastric muscle agenesis in the control group. Conclusions: : The incidence of anterior belly of the digastric muscle agenesis in patients with hemifacial microsomia is high.

Pub-med,Direct tongue neurotization: the effect on speech intelligibility in patients with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome,"Background: M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome is a disorder characterized by developmental impairment of cranial nerve VII, VI, often XII, and other cranial nerves. Facial reanimation in such patients restores the ability of some motion and of limited emotional expression. In one-fourth of these patients, hypoglossal involvement results in severe speech impairment due to tongue atrophy and lack of voluntary mobility. Bilabial incompetence due to facial paralysis further deteriorates speech capability. Direct tongue neurotization has been used by the senior author (J.K.T) to improve tongue function and speech intelligibility in patients with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome. This study presents the senior author's experience with the technique as a component of multistage facial reanimation procedures. Methods: Data collection was performed by retrospective review on six patients with M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome who underwent direct tongue neurotization. In addition, each patient was videotaped for 30 minutes preoperatively and postoperatively according to a standardized protocol. Results: Four independent investigators scored speech intelligibility in each patient using a standardized grading system. The results showed considerable improvement in speech intelligibility and articulation. Higher improvement was noted in patients with partial bilateral hypoglossal involvement than in patients with complete unilateral involvement of the hypoglossal nerve, as well as in younger ages.

Pub-med,"Intraoperative muscle electrical stimulation for accurate positioning of the temporalis muscle tendon during dynamic, one-stage lengthening temporalis myoplasty for facial and lip reanimation","Background: Facial paralysis is a significant functional and aesthetic handicap. Facial reanimation is performed either by two-stage microsurgical methods or by regional one-stage muscle pedicle flaps. Labb‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© has modified and improved the regional muscle pedicle transfer flaps for facial reanimation (i.e., the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure). This true myoplasty technique is capable of producing a coordinated, spontaneous, and symmetrical smile. An intraoperative electrical stimulation of the temporal muscle is proposed to simulate the smile of the paralyzed side on the surgical table. Methods: The intraoperative electrical stimulation of the temporalis muscle, employing direct percutaneous electrode needles or transcutaneous electrical stimulation electrodes, was utilized in 11 primary and four secondary cases with complete facial palsy. The duration of the facial paralysis was up to 12 years. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months. Results: The insertion points of the temporalis muscle tendon to the nasolabial fold, upper lip, and oral commissure had been changed according to the intraoperative muscle stimulation in six patients of the 11 primary cases (55 percent) and in all four secondary (revisional) cases. A coordinated, spontaneous, and symmetrical smile was achieved in all patients by 3 months after surgery by employing speech therapy and biofeedback. Conclusion: This adjunct intraoperative refinement provides crucial feedback for the surgeon in both primary and secondary facial palsy cases regarding the vector of action of the temporalis muscle and the accuracy of the anchoring points of its tendon, thus enhancing a more coordinated and symmetrical smile.",0,,0,1,0,9,4,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181da870b,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2010 Jul;126(1):118-125. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181da870b.,"Har-Shai Y, Gil T, Metanes I, Labb‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© D.",2010,20595862,,11,3,12,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

Pub-med,A single hypoglossal nerve for bilateral smile reconstruction in m‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome,"M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a variety of cranial nerve defects. Although there are several variants of M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome depending on which cranial nerves are affected, the commonest form involves facial and abducens cranial nerve paralysis. Despite several strategies for bilateral smile reconstruction that have been advocated, the condition still presents a challenge to the plastic surgeon. The most acceptable method nowadays is bilateral free neurovascularized muscle transfer. The author represents a new method of using a single hypoglossal nerve to supply both free flaps in a M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius patient. The procedure is done on 2 stages using both latissimus dorsi muscles and a single hypoglossal nerve. The patient regained a natural symmetric smile 12 months after the first stage.

Pub-med,Novel use of C7 spinal nerve for Moebius,"Background: The purpose of this study was to introduce the use of selective ipsilateral C7 spinal nerve transfer to the armamentarium of the dynamic procedures used for facial reanimation in Moebius patients. Methods: Between 1991 and 2007, the selective ipsilateral C7 technique was used in four patients. In three patients with bilateral paralysis, both C7 spinal nerves were utilized as nerve donors. Thus, evaluation of outcomes was carried out in seven hemifaces. Results: Short-term paresthesia on the index pulp of the donor upper extremity was observed in four limbs, which recovered spontaneously. Motor deficits were never noticed. Neurotization of the free-muscle transfer for smile was performed in five hemifaces, with good results in three hemifaces (p < 0.01, z = 2.61). Eye closure neurotization was made in six hemifaces, with good results in four hemifaces (p < 0.01, z = 2.88). Depressor neurotization was made in one case and resulted in improved depressor complex function. In two cases of free muscle transfer for masseter substitution, electromyographic interpretations revealed full motor activity after bilateral latissimus dorsi transfer. Tongue neurotization was performed in two instances. Postoperatively, the patients' speech intelligibility improved as well as tongue motility and bulk. Conclusion: The use of the C7 as a motor donor in Moebius cases with multicranial nerve involvement supplies the typical mask-like face with an abundance of motor fibers for facial reanimation and, if there is a coexisting twelfth nerve palsy, for speech restoration.",0,,2,1,9,9,8,3,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181dbbd79,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2010 Jul;126(1):106-117. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181dbbd79.,"Terzis JK, Konofaos P.",2010,20595861,,7,,,Multiple nerve grafts:nerve transfer,,no nerve transfer,,,['Latissimus dorsi flap'],Latissimus dorsi flap,,

The objective is to analyse the incidence and value of secondary revisions for functional and aesthetic refinements following the two main stages of reanimation. The reconstructive strategy varied according to the denervation time, the aetiology, and whether the paralysis was uni- or bilateral, complete or partial. Irrespective of these variables, 89% of the patients required secondary surgery. Post-operative videos were available in seventy-two cases. Four independent observers graded patients' videos using a scale from poor to excellent. The effect of diverse secondary procedures was measured computing a mean-percent-gain score. Statistical differences between treatment groups means were tested by the t-test and one-way ANOVA. Two-thirds of the corrective and ancillary techniques utilized granted significantly higher mean-scores post-secondary surgery. A comparison of pre- and post-operative data found valuable improvements in all three facial zones after secondary surgery. In conclusion, inherent to dynamic procedures is the need for secondary revisions.

Pub-med,Outcomes of Direct Facial-to-Hypoglossal Neurorrhaphy with Parotid Release,"Lesions of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle and their management can result in facial nerve paralysis. When the nerve deficit is not amenable to primary end-to-end repair or interpositional grafting, nerve transposition can be used to accomplish the goals of restoring facial tone, symmetry, and voluntary movement. The most widely used nerve transposition is the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastamosis, of which there are several technical variations. Previously we described a technique of single end-to-side anastamosis using intratemporal facial nerve mobilization and parotid release. This study further characterizes the results of this technique with a larger patient cohort and longer-term follow-up. The design of this study is a retrospective chart review and the setting is an academic tertiary care referral center. Twenty-one patients with facial nerve paralysis from proximal nerve injury at the cerebellopontine angle underwent facial-hypoglossal neurorraphy with parotid release. Outcomes were assessed using the Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and patient photographs. Of the 21 patients, 18 were successfully reinnervated to a score of a B or C on the recovery scale, which equates to good oral and ocular sphincter closure with minimal mass movement. The mean duration of paralysis between injury and repair was 12.1 months (range 0 to 36 months) with a mean follow-up of 55 months. There were no cases of hemiglossal atrophy, paralysis, or subjective dysfunction. Direct facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with parotid release achieved a functional reinnervation and good clinical outcome in the majority of patients, with minimal lingual morbidity. This technique is a viable option for facial reanimation and should be strongly considered as a surgical option for the paralyzed face.",3,,0,0,1,9,8,1,0,10.1055/s-0030-1261263,Skull Base. 2011 Jan;21(1):7-12. doi: 10.1055/s-0030-1261263.,"Jacobson J, Rihani J, Lin K, Miller PJ, Roland JT Jr.",2011,22451794,"Tools: clinical evaluation, pt. satisfaction questionnaire, Facial Nerve Recovery Scale Outcomes: first contraction, tongue mobility, degree of atrophy, ",21,,,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,A systematic algorithm for the management of lower lip asymmetry,"Purpose: An asymmetric smile, caused by loss of function of the lip depressors, can be functionally and cosmetically debilitating. Although some surgeons report excellent results with muscle transfer to the lower lip, many facial reanimation surgeons find that dynamic techniques do not consistently address the lower lip. Our objectives were to retrospectively review our outcomes after treatment of the asymmetric lower lip, and to propose a progressive, stepwise algorithm for the management of lower lip asymmetry in facial paralysis. Material/methods: Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients treated in a multidisciplinary facial nerve center with lower lip asymmetry over an eighteen month period. Treatment ranged from a temporary trial of lidocaine, to chemodenervation with botulinum toxin, to pedicled digastric muscle transfer, and/or resection of the nonparetic depressor labii inferioris (DLI). Results: Fifty-seven patients were treated with chemodenervation with botulinum toxin, four with anterior belly of the digastric transfer, and 3 with DLI resection. All patients with DLI resection had undergone chemodenervation to the contralateral lower lip with botulinum toxin and were pleased with the appearance of their smile. Conclusions: We have found that lower lip asymmetry is optimally managed by adherence to a standardized protocol that offers patients insight into the likely outcome of chemodenervation or surgery and progresses systematically from the reversible to the irreversible. We present our algorithm for the management of the asymmetric lower lip, which reflects this graduated approach and has resulted in high patient satisfaction.",0,,0,1,,9,4,1,1,10.1016/j.amjoto.2009.08.011,Am J Otolaryngol. 2011 Jan-Feb;32(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/j.amjoto.2009.08.011.

The purpose of this study is to report on a series for dynamic reinnervation of the paralyzed face by using a split 12-7 nerve transposition. The goals of this procedure are to minimize tongue morbidity and to provide good facial reinnervation. Methods: Prospective case series. Melolabial crease discursion, overall facial movement, and degree of tongue atrophy and mobility were recorded. Results: Thirteen patients underwent facial reanimation using a split hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer with postoperative follow-up to 58 months (range, 6-58 months). All patients achieved excellent rest symmetry and facial tone. Of 13 patients, 10 had measurable coordinated movement and discursion of their melolabial crease. Of 13 patients, 12 had mild to moderate ipsilateral tongue atrophy. The mean time to onset of visible reinnervation was 3 months.

Pub-med,Functioning free gracilis myocutaneous flap transfer provides a reliable single-stage facial reconstruction and reanimation following tumor ablation,"Background: Ablative orofacial defects incorporating mimetic facial musculature/nerve cause hemifacial expressive dysfunction and considerable morbidity but are rarely reanimated immediately using free functioning gracilis myocutaneous flaps. Methods: Disrupted buccal branches provided a recipient facial nerve for 24 gracilis reinnervations. An additional 15 free flaps were used for extensive composite defects. Smile outcome was graded according to Terzis' criteria after 2 years of recurrence-free follow-up. The effects of postoperative radiotherapy, integrity of the oral commissure, and double free flaps were compared. Results: Eighteen patients completed 2 years' recurrence-free follow-up; average smile outcome was Terzis grade 4 (mean, 3.8). Resection/reconstruction of the modiolus (five of 18 patients) tended to diminish outcome (Terzis grade 3, mean, 3.0; median, 3; versus Terzis grade 4, mean, 4.1; median, 5) compared with two free flaps performed simultaneously(mean, 3.56 versus 4.14; median, 3 versus 5). Postoperative radiotherapy (eight of 18 patients) had a more modest effect on outcome (Terzis grade 3, mean, 3.3; Terzis grade 4, mean, 4.1; median, 3 versus 5).

Pub-med,Hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis for facial nerve palsy,"Background and purpose: Commonly used classic hypoglossal (CN XII) to facial nerve (CN VII) anastomosis has the disadvantage of tongue hemiatrophy. Thus, various attempts have been made to modify this method to reduce the tongue damage. The aim of this report was to present the results of hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HHFA) technique in relation to facial muscles reanimation and hemitongue atrophy. Material and methods: The first 7 consecutive patients who underwent CN VII anastomosis with half of the CNXII, for which the follow-up period exceeded 12 months, were analysed. During the procedure, CN VII was transected as proximally as possible after drilling the mastoid process. CN XII was separated longitudinally into two parts at a short distance to allow suture of the stumps without any tension. One half of CN XII was transected and sutured to the distal stump of CN VII. Recovery from facial palsy was quantified with the House-Brackmann grading system (HB). Tongue function was assessed according to the scale proposed by Martins. Results: Features of initial reinnervation of facial muscles were visible after 6 months in all 7 patients. All patients achieved satisfactory outcome of CN VII regeneration (HB grade III) until the last control examination (12-27 months after surgery, mean 16). No or minimal tongue atrophy without deviation (grades I-II according to the Martins scale) was found in 4 patients. Mild hemiatrophy with tongue deviation < 30 degrees (grade III) was visible in 3 patients.

Pub-med,Activation of the masseter muscle during normal smile production and the implications for dynamic reanimation surgery for facial paralysis,"Introduction: In cases of unilateral facial paralysis, free muscle transfer with coaptation to the motor nerve of the Masseter is gaining popularity as a primary alternative to cross-facial nerve grafting. Despite initial expectations, a majority of these subjects can achieve a spontaneous smile. The mechanism behind this spontaneity is unclear. Plasticity of the cerebral cortex as well as the relative proximity of the motor centres of the mimetic and Masseter muscles has been used in explanation. This study demonstrates the involvement of the Masseter muscle during normal smile production, suggesting a more direct explanation for the spontaneous smile seen following reanimation procedures innervated by the Masseter nerve. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers were subjected to electromyography of the Masseter muscle bilaterally to demonstrate whether contraction of the Masseter muscle occurred during voluntary and involuntary smile production. Results: Patient age ranged from 20 to 61 years (mean 41.6 years) with an equal male to female ratio. Activation of the Masseter occurred in 40 percent of individual muscles during smile production, occurring bilaterally in six participants, and unilaterally in four. There was no correlation between muscle activation and patient age or gender. Conclusions: Natural contraction of the Masseter muscle during normal smile production helps to explain the high rate of spontaneous smile development in subjects with facial paralysis who have undergone a free muscle reanimation procedure powered by the nerve to the Masseter muscle.",0,,2,1,0,5,6,2,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2011.07.012,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2011 Dec;64(12):1585-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2011.07.012.

Methods: We report a case series of 17 consecutive patients with facial paralysis who underwent minimally invasive temporalis tendon transposition surgery for dynamic facial reanimation between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. The minimally invasive technique is described. Preoperative and postoperative records, photographs, and videos were reviewed for feasibility of the technique, symmetry, oral competence, and dynamic oral commissure movement. Results: All the patients tolerated the procedure well, and none developed procedure-related complications. All the patients achieved improved symmetry at rest and voluntary motion of the oral commissure. In all the patients, the temporalis tendon was transposed to the modiolus without the need for fascial extension or lengthening myoplasty.

Pub-med,Treatment of facial paralysis: dynamic reanimation of spontaneous facial expression-apropos of 655 patients,"Background: Six hundred fifty-five cases of unilateral facial paralysis were treated by different surgical methods to achieve dynamic reanimation of facial muscle movement. In a retrospective study, the recovery of both truly spontaneous smile and facial muscle movement was evaluated independently. Methods: The authors performed 505 two-stage gracilis, one rectus abdominis, and 14 single-stage latissimus dorsi microneurovascular muscle transfers, in addition to 28 cross-facial facial nerve neurotization procedures. These procedures were based on neurotization of the paralyzed region by the contralateral healthy facial nerve. Procedures involving motor nerves or muscle beyond the territory of the facial nerve included 73 temporalis muscle transpositions, four lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedures, 26 neurotizations by the hypoglossal nerve, and four neurotizations by the spinal accessory nerve. Results: Patients treated by techniques based on the motor function of nerves other than the facial nerve did not recover spontaneous smile. Neurotization by the facial nerve, however, did result in the recovery of spontaneous smile in all satisfactory or better outcomes. Recovery of lip commissure movement based on neurotization by the contralateral healthy facial nerve was better than that of the remaining groups (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Temporalis muscle transposition and lengthening myoplasty are acceptable options for patients who are not good candidates for neurotization by the facial nerve. For the restoration of both truly spontaneous smile and facial muscle movement, free microneurovascular muscle transfer neurotized by the contralateral healthy facial nerve has become the authors' first-choice surgical technique.

Results: All patients regained oral competence, good resting tone, and a smile, with a vector and strength comparable to those of the normal side. Motion developed an average of 5.6 months after masseter-to-facial nerve transfer, with 40 percent of patients developing an effortless smile by postoperative month 19. Conclusions: The masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is an effective method for reanimation of the miDFace and perioral region in a select group of facial paralysis patients. The technique is advocated for its limited donor-site morbidity, avoidance of interposition nerve grafts, and potential for cerebral adaptation, producing a strong, potentially effortless smile.",2,,0,0,0,9,8,3,0,10.1097/PRS.0b013e31820e9138,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2011 May;127(5):1909-1915. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0b013e31820e9138.,Klebuc MJA.,2011,21532419,"tools: physical examination, direct measurement of commissure excursion, and video analysis",10,6,20,"Multiple nerve grafts:masseter nerve,Interposition nerve graft",,Masseteric nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Free gracilis transfer for smile in children: the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Experience in excursion and quality-of-life changes,"Background: Free muscle transfer for facial reanimation has become the standard of care in recent decades and is now the cornerstone intervention for dynamic smile reanimation. We sought to quantify smile excursion and quality-of-life (QOL) changes in our pediatric free gracilis recipients following reanimation. Methods: We quantified gracilis muscle excursion in 17 pediatric patients undergoing 19 consecutive pediatric free gracilis transplantation operations, using our validated SMILE program, as an objective measure of functional outcome. These were compared against excursion measured the same way in a cohort of 17 adults with 19 free gracilis operations. In addition, we prospectively evaluated QOL outcomes in these children using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) instrument. Results: The mean gracilis excursion in our pediatric free gracilis recipients was 8.8 mm ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 5.0 mm, which matched adult results, but with fewer complete failures of less than 2-mm excursion, with 2 (11%) and 4 (21%), respectively. Quality-of-life measures indicated statistically significant improvements following dynamic smile reanimation (P = .01). Conclusions: Dynamic facial reanimation using free gracilis transfer in children has an acceptable success rate, yields improved commissure excursion, and improves QOL in the pediatric population. It should be considered first-line therapy for children with lack of a meaningful smile secondary to facial paralysis.",0,,1,0,5,9,8,3,0,10.1001/archfacial.2011.29,Arch Facial Plast Surg. 2011 May-Jun;13(3):190-4. doi: 10.1001/archfacial.2011.29.,"Hadlock TA, Malo JS, Cheney ML, Henstrom DK.",2011,21576665,,17,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Reconstruction of complex peripheral facial nerve defects by a combined approach using facial nerve interpositional graft and hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture,"Objectives/hypothesis: To describe a modified facial nerve reconstruction technique for complex defects of the facial fan after parotid surgery that avoids synkinesis between upper and lower face. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Patients who had undergone radical parotidectomy with a large defect of the facial fan, reconstruction of the upper face by facial nerve interpositional graft, and reconstruction of the lower face by hypoglossal-facial nerve jump nerve suture were included in this series. Results: Four patients underwent the modified combined approach after tumor resection and prior to postoperative radiotherapy in three of the four cases. Surgery was combined with an upper lid weight implantation. Regeneration of the face was successful in all cases within 12 to 16 months. Most important, the separated reanimation of the upper and lower face circumvented synkinesis of the upper and lower face. This factor was essential for good functional results. Using the hypoglossal jump technique instead of a classical cross-nerve suture technique prevented the sacrifice of ipsilateral tongue function. Conclusions: The presented method offers satisfactory results for facial reanimation and avoids synkinesis between the upper and lower face. Using the jump technique instead of a classic hypoglossal transfer as it was described originally for the combined approach avoids long-term sequelae for the tongue.",3,,0,2,0,9,8,3,0,10.1002/lary.22357,Laryngoscope. 2011 Nov;121(11):2402-5. doi: 10.1002/lary.22357.,"Volk GF, Pantel M, Streppel M, Guntinas-Lichius O.",2011,22020891,,4,12,16,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Embase,Color Doppler ultrasound: Effective monitoring of the buried free flap in facial reanimation,"Objective. The gracilis muscle free flap has become a reliable means for smile reanimation for patients with facial paralysis. Because it is a buried flap, it presents a postoperative monitoring challenge. We sought to evaluate our experience with color Doppler ultrasound in the monitoring of gracilis free flap viability in the immediate postoperative setting. Study Design. Case series with planned data collection. Setting. Tertiary medical center. Methods. Patients with facial paralysis treated with gracilis muscle free flap for smile reanimation performed between March 2009 and November 2010 were evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound and included in the study. Our experience with the use of the color Doppler ultrasound to monitor the gracilis muscle flap is presented. Results. Forty-six patients were identified. In all cases, color Doppler ultrasound was used postoperatively to assess flow through the vascular pedicle. Outcomes included an early flap survival rate of 100%, with no instances of equivocal or absent flow on either the arterial or venous side. Color Doppler ultrasound provided important objective information regarding muscle perfusion postoperatively in several instances of equivocal postoperative perfusion of the flap. Conclusion. Color Doppler ultrasound is a safe, noninvasive method that can be performed serially to evaluate a buried free flap. We have had success in verifying normal arterial and venous flow through the pedicle using this method of monitoring of the gracilis muscle free flap during facial reanimation, and in 3 instances, it eliminated the need for wound exploration to verify appropriate muscle perfusion. ¬¨¬© American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2012.",0,,1,0,9,9,7,2,0,10.1177/0194599811427377,Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (2012) 146:3 (372-376).

Pub-med,Surgical site infections after gracilis free flap reconstruction for facial paralysis,"Compared with other free tissue transfer procedures, the gracilis free muscle transfer (GFMT) for facial reanimation is unique in that the recipient site is typically uninvolved by malignancy or infection. In this study, the authors examined the incidence, bacteriology, and outcomes of surgical site infection (SSI) after gracilis free muscle transfer for facial reanimation. From 2003 to 2011, 105 patients underwent 107 GFMT operations, with 6 SSIs. All cases of infection occurred in patients receiving clindamycin, levofloxacin, and/or cefazolin perioperatively. None of the patients who received ampicillin-sulbactam developed an SSI. Surgical site cultures grew oral flora, including ‚Äö√¢√†‚àö‚â†¬¨¬®¬¨¬±-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Fusobacterium and Neisseria species, and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

Pub-med,Comparison of hemihypoglossal-facial nerve transposition with a cross-facial nerve graft and muscle transplant for the rehabilitation of facial paralysis using the facial clima method,"To compare quantitatively the results obtained after hemihypoglossal nerve transposition and microvascular gracilis transfer associated with a cross facial nerve graft (CFNG) for reanimation of a paralysed face, 66 patients underwent hemihypoglossal transposition (n = 25) or microvascular gracilis transfer and CFNG (n = 41). The commissural displacement (CD) and commissural contraction velocity (CCV) in the two groups were compared using the system known as Facial clima. There was no inter-group variability between the groups (p > 0.10) in either variable. However, intra-group variability was detected between the affected and healthy side in the transposition group (p = 0.036 and p = 0.017, respectively). The transfer group had greater symmetry in displacement of the commissure (CD) and commissural contraction velocity (CCV) than the transposition group and patients were more satisfied.

Pub-med,Facial movement before and after masseteric-facial nerves anastomosis: a three-dimensional optoelectronic pilot study,"To quantify the effects of facial palsy reanimation, 14 patients aged 17-66 years were analysed. All patients had unilateral facial paralysis, and were candidates for surgical masseteric to facial nerve anastomosis. Two patient groups were measured: seven patients were waiting for surgery, the other seven patients had already been submitted to surgery, and had regained facial mimicry. Each patient performed three facial animations: brow raise; free smile; lip purse. These were recorded using an optoelectronic motion analyser. The three-dimensional coordinates of facial landmarks were obtained, their movements were computed, and asymmetry indices calculated (differential movements between the two hemi-faces: healthy and paretic/rehabilitated). Before surgery, mobility was larger in the healthy than in the paretic side; after surgery, the differences were reduced (brow raise and lip purse), or even reversed (smile). Before surgery, lip purse was performed with significant labial asymmetry (p=0.042; larger healthy side movement). After surgery, asymmetry indices reduced. Total labial asymmetry during smiling was significantly different from 0 before surgery (p=0.018, larger healthy side movement). After surgery, all asymmetry indices became non-significant.

Methods: Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation (FACE) software was designed for facial analysis. Outputs report the static facial landmark positions and dynamic facial movements relevant in facial reanimation. Fifty individuals underwent facial movement analysis using Photoshop-based measurements and the new software; comparisons of agreement and efficiency were made. Comparisons were made between individuals with normal facial animation and patients with paralysis to gauge sensitivity to abnormal movements. Results: Facial measurements were matched using FACE software and Photoshop-based measures at rest and during expressions. The automated assessments required significantly less time than Photoshop-based assessments.FACE measurements easily revealed differences between individuals with normal facial animation and patients with facial paralysis. Conclusions: FACE software produces accurate measurements of facial landmarks and facial movements and is sensitive to paralysis.

Pub-med,Rehabilitation of central facial paralysis with hypoglossal-facial anastomosis,"Objective: To evaluate the ability of hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis to reanimate the face in patients with complete nuclear (central) facial nerve palsy. Study design: Retrospective case series. Setting: Tertiary academic medical center. Patients: Four patients with complete facial nerve paralysis due to lesions of the facial nucleus in the pons caused by hemorrhage due to arteriovenous or cavernous venous malformations, stroke, or injury after tumor resection. Intervention: All patients underwent end-to-end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis. Main outcome measures: Facial nerve function using the House-Brackmann (HB) scale and physical and social/well-being function using the facial disability index. Results: The mean age of the patients was 53.3 years (range, 32-73). There were 3 female and 1 male patients. All patients had preoperative facial function HB VI/VI. With a minimum of 12 months' follow-up after end-to-end hypoglossal-facial anastomosis, 75% of patients regained function to HB grade III/VI, and 25% had HB grade IV/VI. Average facial disability index scores were 61.25 for physical function and 78 for social/well-being, comparable to results from complete hypoglossal-facial anastomosis after peripheral facial nerve palsy after acoustic neuroma resection. Conclusion: Patients with nuclear facial paralysis who undergo end-to-end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis achieve similar degrees of reanimation compared with those with peripheral facial nerve palsies.

Pub-med,Use of the masseter motor nerve in facial animation with free muscle transfer,"Facial paralysis is either congenital or acquired, and of varying severity, which leads to an asymmetrical or absent facial expression. It is an important disability both from the aesthetic and functional points of view. Between 2003 and 2008, at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Parma, Italy, 21 patients with facial paralysis had their faces reanimated with a gracilis transplant reinnervated by the masseter motor nerve. All free-muscle transplants survived the transfer, and no flap was lost. Facial symmetry at rest and while smiling was excellent or good in most cases, and we found an appreciable improvement in both speech and oral competence. We consider that the masseter motor nerve is a powerful and reliable donor nerve, which allows us to obtain movement of the commissure and upper lip similar to those of the normal site for degree and direction. There may be a role for the masseter motor nerve in innervation of patients with facial paralysis.",5,,1,0,0,9,2,1,0,10.1016/j.bjoms.2011.07.019,Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2012 Oct;50(7):650-3. doi: 10.1016/j.bjoms.2011.07.019.

Pub-med,Experience with 60 adult patients with facial paralysis secondary to tumor extirpation,"Background: The aim of this study was to present the authors' experience with facial reanimation in adult patients following tumor extirpation and to analyze the functional outcomes. Methods: From 1978 to 2006, 60 adult patients underwent facial reanimation for facial paralysis following tumor extirpation. There was one patient with bilateral facial paralysis. Thus, evaluation was carried out in 61 hemifaces. Three independent assessors evaluated the preoperative and postoperative videos using the Terzis grading scale for eye closure, smile, depressor, and overall aesthetic and functional outcomes. Preoperative and postoperative electromyographic interpretations and the effect of demographic variables were also evaluated. Results: There was significant improvement regarding preoperative versus postoperative outcomes for overall aesthesis and function. Good and excellent results were observed in 72.14 percent of the hemifaces (n = 44). The difference between preoperative and postoperative electromyographic results was of statistical significance (p < 0.0001) for each target reinnervated. Better results were observed in younger patients (‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬¢¬¨¬®‚àö√º 35 years) (p = 0.023) and in early cases (p = 0.019). Conclusions: : The results of this present series illustrate that age and denervation time correlate with the final functional outcome. Cross-facial nerve grafts should ideally be used in patients with denervation time less than 6 months or more than 2 years combined with muscle transfers. In patients with a denervation time between 6 months and 2 years, the use of the babysitter procedure can yield a superior outcome.

Pub-med,Comparison of hemihypoglossal nerve versus masseteric nerve transpositions in the rehabilitation of short-term facial paralysis using the Facial Clima evaluating system,"Background: Masseteric and hypoglossal nerve transfers are reliable alternatives for reanimating short-term facial paralysis. To date, few studies exist in the literature comparing these techniques. This work presents a quantitative comparison of masseter-facial transposition versus hemihypoglossal facial transposition with a nerve graft using the Facial Clima system. Methods: Forty-six patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis underwent reanimation with either hemihypoglossal transposition with a nerve graft (group I, n = 25) or direct masseteric-facial coaptation (group II, n = 21). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the Facial Clima system. Postoperative intragroup commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity means of the reanimated versus the normal side were first compared using a paired sample t test. Then, mean percentages of recovery of both parameters were compared between the groups using an independent sample t test. Onset of movement was also compared between the groups. Results: Significant differences of mean commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity between the reanimated side and the normal side were observed in group I but not in group II. Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters did not differ between the groups. Patients in group II showed a significantly faster onset of movement compared with those in group I (62 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 4.6 days versus 136 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 7.4 days, p = 0.013). Conclusions: Reanimation of short-term facial paralysis can be satisfactorily addressed by means of either hemihypoglossal transposition with a nerve graft or direct masseteric-facial coaptation. However, with the latter, better symmetry and a faster onset of movement are observed. In addition, masseteric nerve transfer avoids morbidity from nerve graft harvesting.

Pub-med,Recovery of emotional smiling function in free-flap facial reanimation,"Purpose: Long-standing unilateral facial palsy is treated primarily with free-flap surgery using the masseteric or contralateral facial nerve as a motor source. The use of a gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve restores the smiling function, without obtaining spontaneity. Because emotional smiling is an important factor in facial reanimation, the facial nerve must serve as the motor source to achieve this fundamental target. Materials and methods: From October 1998 to October 2009, 50 patients affected by long-standing unilateral facial paralysis underwent single-stage free-flap reanimation procedures to recover smiling function. A latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve was transplanted in 40 patients, and a gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve in 10 patients. All patients underwent a clinical examination that analyzed voluntary and spontaneous smiling. Results: All patients who received a latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve and recovered muscle function (92.5%) showed voluntary and spontaneous smiling abilities. All patients who received a gracilis free flap innervated by the masseteric nerve recovered function, but only 1 (10%) showed occasional spontaneous flap activation. During those rare activations, much less movement was visible on the operated side than when the patient was asked to smile voluntarily. Conclusions: The masseteric nerve is a powerful motor source that guarantees free voluntary gracilis muscle activation; however, it does not guarantee any spontaneous smiling. Single-stage procedures that use a latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve have a lower success rate and obtain less movement; however, spontaneous smiling is always observed.",2,,1,0,0,2,8,1,0,10.1016/j.joms.2011.11.031,J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2012 Oct;70(10):2413-8. doi: 10.1016/j.joms.2011.11.031.

In spite of the improvements in microsurgical techniques, failures due to absent revascularization or reinnervation of the transplanted muscle or infections causing flap necrosis are observed. We propose a second surgical procedure based on the gracilis muscle transplant reinnervated by the masseteric nerve as a solution for these cases. Methods: We analyzed and report on two patients treated in our department after the failure of a previous cross-facial nerve graft and free muscle transplant. They were treated with a new facial reanimation using the contralateral gracilis muscle and the masseteric nerve as the donor nerve. Results and discussion: We did not observe any postoperative complications, and all of the flaps survived. Reinnervation and contraction of the muscle appeared 3-4 months postoperatively, with good functional and aesthetic results. Conclusions: This technique is a one-step procedure characterized by reliable flap harvesting, low donor site morbidity and good activity of the masseteric nerve.

Pub-med,Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer: is it possible to rehabilitate the function of both the paralyzed eyelid and the oral commissure?,"Background: This report addresses the efficiency of masseter-to-facial nerve transfer and investigates the patient's ability to perform the functions of eyelid closure and smile movements independently. Methods: From November 2010 to January 2012, seven patients underwent the reported procedure and were followed 6 to 12 months postoperatively. The patients' ages varied from 22 to 41 years. The etiology of the injuries was resection of cerebellopontine angle tumors in all the patients. Using Terzis' and Mehta's scale, smile outcomes and synkinetic movements were evaluated pre- and post-operatively. The function of eyelid closure was evaluated by measuring the width of the lagophthalmos. A questionnaire was applied to evaluate ocular problems and donor-site morbidity. Results: All the patients were able to close their eyelids and smile with biting. Four of the seven patients were able to smile effortlessly without biting. According to Terzis' scale, the postoperative mean score was 4.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.8 compared with 1.0 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.0 at the preoperative evaluation. The improvement in the lagophthalmos varied from 2 to 5 mm. The ocular problems all were resolved. All the patients were able to smile easily without eyelid closure and could close their eyes with minimal oral commissure movement. No patients reported weakness of mastication on the affected side, and only minimal atrophy of the masseter muscle at the donor site was noted. Conclusions: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a highly efficient technique for reanimating paralyzed muscle. After physical training, both eyelid closure and smiling are restored and discriminated after physical training.

Pub-med,Simultaneous anterolateral thigh flap and temporalis tendon transfer to optimize facial form and function after radical parotidectomy,"Background Extirpation of aggressive parotid or cutaneous facial tumors often involves facial nerve sacrifice and the creation of a large soft-tissue defect. We describe a method for single-stage reconstruction during radical parotidectomy to restore facial form and function without additional morbidity. Methods We conducted a review of immediate reconstruction/reanimation of radical parotidectomy defects with the use of anterolateral thigh (ALT) fat and fascia flaps for facial contouring, orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer (OTTT), cable grafting of the facial nerve, and fascia lata lower lip suspension. Results Five patients (mean age, 67.4 years) underwent extirpation of malignant tumors with facial nerve sacrifice resulting in large soft-tissue deficits. All patients had ALT free tissue transfer to correct facial contour defects and OTTT to restore facial form and function. Four patients underwent cable grafting of facial nerve branches. Branches of the motor nerve to the vastus lateralis harvested from the ALT surgical site were used for cable nerve grafting in 3 patients. Fascia lata from the same ALT harvest site was used for lower lip suspension to the OTTT in 4 patients. There were no donor site complications.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation by one-stage microneurovascular free abductor hallucis muscle transplantation: personal experience and long-term outcomes,"Background: In 1990, Jiang Hua introduced a new method using one-stage reconstruction with free abductor hallucis muscle transfer for dynamic reanimation of established unilateral facial paralysis. The authors present their experience with this procedure and analyze the postoperative complications and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Methods: From March of 1990 to March of 2010, 45 patients underwent the free abductor hallucis muscle transfer procedure in the authors' department. Forty-one were followed up for 54.6 months (range, 28 months to 17 years). The Toronto Facial Grading System and Facial Nerve Function Index were used to evaluate facial nerve function at 2 years after surgery and last follow-up. Complications and function of the donor foot were analyzed. Results: No postoperative mortality was found. Complications occurred in four of 41 patients, including muscle loss, infection, hematoma, and hypertrophic scar. The others obtained satisfactory symmetric faces in the static state and in voluntary contraction of the transferred muscles. Mean values for the Toronto Facial Grading System (50.6¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±7.8) and the Facial Nerve Function Index (65.7¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±11.4 percent) were significantly higher at 2 years postoperatively in comparison with preoperative status (21.2¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±5.3 and 19.5¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±3.6 percent, respectively) (p<0.05). Long-term outcomes (Toronto Facial Grading System, 54.8¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±6.9; Facial Nerve Function Index, 79.4¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±9.6 percent) were awarded higher values than early outcomes shown at 2 years postoperatively (p<0.05). Conclusions: Free abductor hallucis muscle transfer is safe and effective in dynamic reanimation of longstanding unilateral facial paralysis. Favorable long-term results demonstrate that the authors' technique is an alternative method for facial reanimation.

Embase,Hemihypoglossal nerve transfer for acute facial paralysis: Clinical article,"Object. The authors have developed a technique for the treatment of facial paralysis that utilizes anastomosis of the split hypoglossal and facial nerve. Here, they document improvements in the procedure and experimental evidence supporting the approach. Methods. They analyzed outcomes in 36 patients who underwent the procedure, all of whom had suffered from facial paralysis following the removal of large vestibular schwannomas. The average period of paralysis was 6.2 months. The authors used 5 different variations of a procedure for selecting the split nerve, including evaluation of the split nerve using recordings of evoked potentials in the tongue. Results. Successful facial reanimation was achieved in 16 of 17 patients using the cephalad side of the split hypoglossal nerve and in 15 of 15 patients using the caudal side. The single unsuccessful case using the cephalad side of the split nerve resulted from severe infection of the cheek. Procedures using the ansa cervicalis branch yielded poor success rates (2 of 4 cases). Some tongue atrophy was observed in all variants of the procedure, with 17 cases of minimal atrophy and 14 cases of moderate atrophy. No procedure led to severe atrophy causing functional deficits of the tongue. Conclusions. The split hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis procedure consistently leads to good facial reanimation, and the use of either half of the split hypoglossal nerve results in facial reanimation and moderate tongue atrophy. ¬¨¬©AANS, 2013.",4,,0,0,9,9,2,1,0,10.3171/2012.9.JNS1270,Journal of Neurosurgery (2013) 118:1 (160-166).

Pub-med,Long-term facial nerve function following facial reanimation after translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery: A comparison between sural grafting and VII-XII anastomosis,"The aim of this study was to compare the recovery of long-term facial nerve function between patients who received sural grafts and those who underwent hypoglossal-facial anastomosis techniques following translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery. This study included 25 patients with vestibular schwannomas treated with translabyrinthine tumor removal. All patients had large tumors with a mean tumor size of 3.12 cm. Of these patients, six had progressive tumor enlargement symptoms and had been treated previously with stereotactic irradiation. Preoperatively, all patients had normal facial functions, and total tumor removal with a translabyrinthine approach was achieved in all cases. During surgery, the facial nerve was interrupted in all 25 patients. Two types of facial reanimation were performed. Sural grafts were placed in 13 patients and hypoglossal-facial (VII-XII) anastomosis was performed in the other 12. Facial nerve function and surgical outcomes were observed upon discharge, in the short term (one year following surgery), and in the long term (three years following surgery). Total facial paresis was observed in all patients upon discharge. In the sural graft group, House-Brackmann grade III facial function was achieved in four patients upon short-term evaluation and in ten upon long-term evaluation, while House-Brackmann grade IV facial function was achieved in nine patients upon short-term evaluation and three in the long term. In the VII-XII anastomosis group, House-Brackmann grade III facial function was achieved in two patients in the short term and eight in the long term, and House-Brackmann grade IV facial function was achieved in ten patients in the short term and four in the long term. There was a statistically significant difference in the facial recovery results between the short- and long-term follow-up periods. The sural graft group exhibited a marked improvement in results compared with the VII-XII anastomosis group, but no statistically significant difference in facial function was observed between the two facial reanimation groups at either the short- or long-term follow-up. In the sural graft group, synkinesia, noted in three patients, was the most frequently observed complication. Claudication was common upon discharge (four patients), but diminished during follow-up. Disarticulation was the most common complication in the VII-XII anastomosis group (five patients); numbness of the tongue was the second most common complication (four patients). None of the patients developed dysphagia. Facial reanimation is an effective procedure for the surgical rehabilitation of static and dynamic facial nerve functions. Significant improvement in facial nerve function may occur more than three years after surgery. Despite morbidities such as synkinesia, the sural graft technique demonstrates greater improvements in facial nerve function than VII-XII anastomosis in the short and long term following surgery, but this conclusion requires confirmation by larger studies with a greater number of patients.",1,,0,2,9,9,2,1,0,10.3892/etm.2013.1120,Exp Ther Med. 2013 Jul;6(1):101-104. doi: 10.3892/etm.2013.1120.

Pub-med,Fifteen-year survey of one-stage latissimus dorsi muscle transfer for treatment of longstanding facial paralysis,"Background: Neurovascular free muscle transfer is one of the main reconstructive options for established or long-standing facial paralysis. The two-stage gracilis muscle transfer combined with the cross-face nerve graft (two-stage method) has been supplanted by one-stage reconstruction using the latissimus dorsi muscle (LD) at our institution. This study retrospectively evaluated the results of one-stage LD transfer. Methods: Between September 1993 and December 2008, 344 patients (133 males, 211 females; age range, 5-75 years) with unilateral facial paralysis underwent 351 one-stage LD transfers. Patients were evaluated with a custom grading scale. Differences in grading scale score were compared according to age, past surgical history and the duration from operation to neuromuscular recovery. Results: Contraction of the transferred muscle was recognised in 305 (87.0%) transfers. The duration until neuromuscular recovery ranged from 3 to 16 months (average ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± standard deviation: 6.48 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.92 months). The grading scale was significantly lower in middle-age group than in younger and elder groups (P < 0.01). Duration until neuromuscular recovery was significantly different when comparing the younger group and the oldest group. There was no difference in grading scale score or in duration until neuromuscular recovery when comparing the patients with a past surgical history and those without. The grading scale negatively correlated with the duration until neuromuscular recovery. Conclusions: The results are consistent and statistical analysis revealed the versatility of the one-stage LD transfer. Although we believe the two-stage method is still a good option for facial reanimation, the one-stage method is advantageous regarding the shorter period of recovery and little donor-site morbidity.",0,,2,0,0,7,2,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2012.08.004,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2013 Jan;66(1):29-36. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2012.08.004.

Pub-med,Involuntary movement during mastication in patients with long-term facial paralysis reanimated with a partial gracilis free neuromuscular flap innervated by the masseteric nerve,"Background: MiDFace reanimation in patients with chronic facial paralysis is not always possible with an ipsilateral or contralateral facial nerve innervating a free neuromuscular tissue transfer. Alternate use of nonfacial nerves is occasionally indicated but may potentially result in inadvertent motions. The goal of this study was to objectively review videos of patients who underwent one-stage reanimation with a gracilis muscle transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve for (1) inadvertent motion during eating, (2) characterization of masticatory patterns, and (3) social hindrance perceived by the patients during meals. Methods: Between the years 2009 and 2012, 18 patients underwent miDFacial reanimation with partial gracilis muscle transfer coapted to the masseter nerve for treatment of miDFacial paralysis. Sixteen patients were videotaped in detail while eating. Involuntary miDFace movement on the reconstructed side and mastication patterns were assessed. In addition, 16 patients were surveyed as to whether involuntary motion constituted a problem in their daily lives. Results: All 16 patients videotaped during mastication demonstrated involuntary motion on the reconstructed side while eating. Several unique masticatory patterns were noted as well. Only one of the 16 patients reported involuntary motion as a minor disturbance in daily life during meals. Conclusions: All patients with chronic facial paralysis who plan to undergo miDFace reanimation with a free tissue transfer innervated by the ipsilateral masseter nerve should be told that they would universally have involuntary animation during mastication. Most patients do not consider this a major drawback in their daily lives.

Pub-med,One-stage procedure using spinal accessory nerve (XI)-innervated free muscle for facial paralysis reconstruction,"Background: For the treatment of facial paralysis, functioning free muscle transplantation has become accepted standard treatment. Choice of donor nerve and number of surgery stages, however, are still matters of great debate. Methods: Between 2000 and 2011, 36 patients (out of 329; 11 percent) with 42 functioning free muscle transplantations were treated using spinal accessory nerve (XI)-innervated muscle for facial reanimation as a one-stage procedure. Indications included bilateral or unilateral M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°bius syndrome, severe postparetic facial synkinesis, and patient preference. Postoperative smile training was required to achieve spontaneous smile. For outcome assessment, patients were evaluated using multidisciplinary methods, including objective smile excursion score (range, 0 to 4), cortical adaptation stage (range, I to V), tickle test, and subjective patient questionnaire and satisfaction score (range, 1 to 5). Results: Mean smile excursion score improved from 0.5 preoperatively to 3.4 postoperatively. Eighty-three percent of patients were able to perform independent and even spontaneous smile after 1 year of follow-up. Ninety percent of patients had a mean satisfaction score of 3.4 out of 5. However, 50 percent expressed more concern with aesthetic appearance than functional status. There was no functional morbidity of the donor shoulder in daily life. Conclusions: The classic two-stage procedure is still the first choice for facial paralysis reconstruction. However, the effectiveness of XI-innervated free muscle for facial reanimation in a one-stage procedure has proven it to be a good alternative treatment. It has become second in popularity for facial paralysis reconstruction in the authors' center.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation with gracilis muscle transfer neurotized to cross-facial nerve graft versus masseteric nerve: a comparative study using the FACIAL CLIMA evaluating system,"Background: Longstanding unilateral facial paralysis is best addressed with microneurovascular muscle transplantation. Neurotization can be obtained from the cross-facial or the masseter nerve. The authors present a quantitative comparison of both procedures using the FACIAL CLIMA system. Methods: Forty-seven patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis underwent reanimation with a free gracilis transplant neurotized to either a cross-facial nerve graft (group I, n=20) or to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve (group II, n=27). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the FACIAL CLIMA system. Postoperative intragroup commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity means of the reanimated versus the normal side were first compared using the independent samples t test. Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters were compared between the groups using the independent samples t test. Results: Significant differences of mean commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity between the reanimated side and the normal side were observed in group I (p=0.001 and p=0.014, respectively) but not in group II. Intergroup comparisons showed that both commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were higher in group II, with significant differences for commissural displacement (p=0.048). Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters was higher in group II, with significant differences for commissural displacement (p=0.042). Conclusions: Free gracilis muscle transfer neurotized by the masseteric nerve is a reliable technique for reanimation of longstanding facial paralysis. Compared with cross-facial nerve graft neurotization, this technique provides better symmetry and a higher degree of recovery.

Embase,Cross-face nerve grafting for reanimation of incomplete facial paralysis: Quantitative outcomes using the FACIAL CLIMA system and patient satisfaction,"Although in most cases Bell palsy resolves spontaneously, approximately one-third of patients will present sequela including facial synkinesis and paresis. Currently, the techniques available for reanimation of these patients include hypoglossal nerve transposition, free muscle transfer, and cross-face nerve grafting (CFNG). Between December 2008 and March 2012, eight patients with incomplete unilateral facial paralysis were reanimated with two-stage CFNG. Gender, age at surgery, etiology of paralysis denervation time, donor and recipient nerves, presence of facial synkinesis, and follow-up were registered. Commissural excursion and velocity and patient satisfaction were evaluated with the FACIAL CLIMA and a questionnaire, respectively. Mean age at surgery was 33.8 ¬¨¬± 11.5 years; mean time of denervation was 96.6 ¬¨¬± 109.8 months. No complications requiring surgery were registered. Follow-up period ranged from 7 to 33 months with a mean of 19 ¬¨¬± 9.7 months. FACIAL CLIMA showed improvement of both commissural excursion and velocity greater than 75% in 4 patients, greater than 50% in 2 patients, and less than 50% in the remaining two patients.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation utilizing combined orthodromic temporalis muscle flap and end-to-side cross-face nerve grafts,"Background: Individuals with facial paralysis of 6 months or more without evidence of clinical or electromyographic improvement have been successfully reanimated utilizing an orthodromic temporalis transfer in conjunction with end-to-side cross-face nerve grafts. The temporalis muscle insertion is released from the coronoid process of the mandible and sutured to a fascia lata graft that is secured distally to the commissure and paralyzed hemilip. The orthodromic transfer of the temporalis muscle overcomes the concave temporal deformity and zygomatic fullness produced by the turning down of the central third of the muscle (Gillies procedure) while yielding stronger muscle contraction and a more symmetric smile. The muscle flap is combined with cross-face sural nerve grafts utilizing end-to-side neurorrhaphies to import myelinated motor fibers to the paralyzed muscles of facial expression in the miDFace and perioral region. Cross-face nerve grafting provides the potential for true spontaneous facial motion. We feel that the synergy created by the combination of techniques can perhaps produce a more symmetrical and synchronized smile than either procedure in isolation. Methods: Nineteen patients underwent an orthodromic temporalis muscle flap in conjunction with cross-face (buccal-buccal with end-to-side neurorrhaphy) nerve grafts. To evaluate the symmetry of the smile, we measured the length of the two hemilips (normal and affected) using the CorelDRAW X3 software. Measurements were obtained in the pre- and postoperative period and compared for symmetry. Results: There was significant improvement in smile symmetry in 89.5 % of patients. Conclusion: Orthodromic temporalis muscle transfer in conjunction with cross face nerve grafts creates a synergistic effect frequently producing an aesthetic, symmetric smile.

Pub-med,Dynamic facial reanimation with orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer in children,"Importance: To our knowledge, orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer (OTTT) for dynamic facial reanimation has not been described for use in children. Observations: Three pediatric patients with permanent facial paralysis underwent OTTT using our modified technique between August 30, 2010, and January 23, 2012. Outcomes were assessed by the surgeons, patients, and patient families, with the longest follow-up period being 13 months after surgery. Two patients were 4 years old at the time of surgery, and the third patient was 17 years old. All underwent upper eyelid gold weight placement and OTTT. The hospital length of stay was 1 to 2 nights. By the first postoperative visit, all patients exhibited improved symmetry at rest, creation of a melolabial crease, and voluntary movement of the oral commissure and smile production without physical therapy. Conclusions and relevance: The OTTT for dynamic facial reanimation in children seems to be safe and effective. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of this procedure in pediatric patients. This procedure has an advantage over free muscle transfer procedures in achieving immediate dynamic reanimation in a single-stage surgical procedure, without significant additional donor site morbidity.

Methods: We developed specialized software capable of simultaneously tracking the position over time of a number of anatomical points. This method was tested in 5 different clinical situations: one normal subject, and 4 patients with facial disfigurement. Results: A large amount of quantitative information can be extracted directly, such as symmetry assessment in the contraction and relaxation trajectories. The fact that this plot is on scale allows also direct measurements such as maximal extensions. Even smiles that at the macro-scale are essentially symmetrical show at the micro-scale small asymmetries/variability.

Pub-med,Objective outcomes analysis following microvascular gracilis transfer for facial reanimation: a review of 10 years' experience,"IMPORTANCE Objective assessment of smile outcome after microvascular free gracilis transfer is challenging, and quantification of smile outcomes in the literature is inconsistent. OBJECTIVE To report objective excursion and symmetry outcomes from a series of free gracilis cases and investigate the predictive value of intraoperative measurements on final outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective medical chart review was undertaken of all patients who underwent microvascular free gracilis transfer for smile at our institution over the past 10 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcome measures included the following: smile excursion, angle of smile with respect to the vertical midline, and facial symmetry during repose and with smile. Measurements were obtained using an automated tool for assessment of facial landmarks (FACE-Gram). An exhaustive set of intraoperative parameters including degree of recoil of the gracilis muscle following harvest, the degree to which the muscle foreshortened during stimulation of the obturator nerve, final stretched length of the inset muscle, surgeon assessment of neurorrhaphy and pulse pressure, ischemia time, number of sutures used during neurorrhaphy, nerve used to innervate the flap, and surgeon assessment of oral commissure overcorrection were recorded and placed into a linear regression model to investigate correlations with smile. RESULTS From March 2003 to March 2013, 154 microvascular free gracilis transfers were performed for facial reanimation at our institution, 14 (9%) of which were deemed failures. Of the remaining 140 flaps, 127 fulfilled inclusion criteria and constituted the study cohort. Smile excursion, angle excursion, and symmetry of the oral commissure at repose and with smile all improved following gracilis free flap (P < .05). Associations between selected outcomes measures and intraoperative gracilis measurements were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Facial reanimation using free gracilis transfer results in quantifiable improvements in oral commissure excursion and facial symmetry both at rest and with smiling. Associations between contractility and internal recoil of the flap and final outcome were identified.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation with masseteric to facial nerve transfer: a three-dimensional longitudinal quantitative evaluation,"Facial paralysis is a severe pathological condition, negatively affecting patients' quality of life. The altered tone and mobility of the mimetic musculature provoke both functional and morphological deficits. In the present study, we longitudinally measured facial movements in 14 patients (21-69 years) affected by unilateral facial paralysis not lasting longer than 23 months. The patients were analyzed before and after surgical masseteric to facial nerve neurorrhaphy. Examinations were performed at least 3 months after they had clinically started to regain facial mimicry. The displacement of selected facial landmarks was measured using an optoelectronic three-dimensional motion analyzer during: maximum smile without clenching (pre- and postsurgery), maximum smile by clenching on their posterior teeth (only postsurgery), and spontaneous smile (recorded during the vision of a funny video in both examinations). Before facial surgery, in all smiles facial landmarks moved more in the healthy than in the paretic side; after surgery, the differences decreased for both reduction of the healthy-side motion, and increment of the paretic-side motion (motion ratio before 52%, after 87%, p < 0.05, Students' t-test). The ratio between the paretic and healthy-side total motion (asymmetry) did not modify for maximum and spontaneous smiles, but significantly increased for the maximum smiles made with teeth clenching (asymmetry before 32%, after 11%, p < 0.001). Spontaneous smiles were recorded only in a subset of patients, but their execution was modified by surgery, with more symmetrical movements of the rehabilitated-side landmarks (asymmetry before 33%, after 10%), and reduced motion of the healthy-side ones (motion ratio before 51%, after 83%). In conclusion, the significant asymmetry in the magnitude of facial movements that characterized the analyzed patients before surgery reduced after surgery, at least in those facial areas interested by the masseteric to facial nerve reanimation.",0,,0,0,3,9,1,2,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2014.05.039,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2014 Oct;67(10):1378-86. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2014.05.039.

Pub-med,In vivo excursion of the temporalis muscle-tendon unit using electrical stimulation: application in the design of smile restoration surgery following facial paralysis,"Importance: The temporalis muscle has the potential to substitute for the function of paralyzed facial muscles in a single-stage procedure when transferred as a muscle-tendon unit (MTU). Objective: To measure the available excursion of the temporalis MTU after release from the coronoid. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Thirteen consecutive patients undergoing the temporalis MTU transfer procedure for facial reanimation participated in this study in an academic research setting. Main outcomes and measures: Using transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the temporalis muscle, excursion of the temporalis muscle after its release as an MTU was recorded. Tension was varied on the released tendon during electrical stimulation of the muscle to determine the optimal muscle length at which the maximum excursion could be achieved. The tendon was inserted at the modiolus at the determined muscle length, and excursion of the oral commissure was recorded. Excursion data were then measured from the video recordings. RESULTS The mean excursion of the temporalis tendon after its detachment from the mandible and stimulation at an optimized passive tension was 20.6 mm (range, 14-30 mm) (n = 9). Following tendon insertion, the mean oral commissure excursion was 15.5 mm (range, 8-23 mm) (n = 13). Conclusions and relevance: The temporalis MTU has adequate available excursion following mobilization for dynamic reanimation of the paralyzed face. Electrical stimulation of the released temporalis tendon gives useful information that is reproducible and can be an important intraoperative adjunct to setting the MTU at an optimal tension to maximize force generation and excursion.

Pub-med,Cortical adaptation staging system: a new and simple staging for result evaluation of functioning free-muscle transplantation for facial reanimation,"Background: Movement-associated cortical reorganization occurs in patients after functioning free-muscle transplantation (FFMT), which is reinnervated by different neurotizers. Aiming to evaluate the process of recovery of the reinnervated muscle, we defined the cortical reorganization into 5 stages. This staging system has been applied during the past 25 years at our center with great convenience and accessibility. Methods: A standardized evaluation method for assessing the recovery after FFMT to reanimate the paralyzed face with at least a 1-year follow-up was applied. The evaluation included the following 5 stages: no movement, dependent movement, independent movement, and spontaneous movement with and without involuntary movement. Reliability of this technique was assessed by 3 examiners, who each evaluated the smiles of 30 unilateral facial paralysis patients 4 times, creating 360 sets of measurements. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients for interrater and intrarater reliability exceeded 0.929, which is considered excellent and reliable.

Pub-med,The masseteric nerve: a versatile power source in facial animation techniques,"The masseteric nerve has many advantages including low morbidity, its proximity to the facial nerve, the strong motor impulse, its reliability, and the fast reinnervation that is achievable in most patients. Reinnervation of a neuromuscular transplant is the main indication for its use, but it has been used for the treatment of recent facial palsies with satisfactory results. We have retrospectively evaluated 60 patients who had facial animation procedures using the masseteric nerve during the last 10 years. The patients included those with recent, and established or congenital, unilateral and bilateral palsies. The masseteric nerve was used for coaptation of the facial nerve either alone or in association with crossfacial nerve grafting, or for the reinnervation of gracilis neuromuscular transplants. Reinnervation was successful in all cases, the mean (range) time being 4 (2-5) months for facial nerve coaptation and 4 (3-7) months for neuromuscular transplants. Cosmesis was evaluated (moderate, n=10, good, n=30, and excellent, n=20) as was functional outcome (no case of impairment of masticatory function, all patients able to smile, and achievement of a smile independent from biting). The masseteric nerve has many uses, including in both recent, and established or congenital, cases. In some conditions it is the first line of treatment.

Pub-med,Masseteric nerve for reanimation of the smile in short-term facial paralysis,"Our aim was to describe our experience with the masseteric nerve in the reanimation of short term facial paralysis. We present our outcomes using a quantitative measurement system and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Between 2000 and 2012, 23 patients had their facial paralysis reanimated by masseteric-facial coaptation. All patients are presented with complete unilateral paralysis. Their background, the aetiology of the paralysis, and the surgical details were recorded. A retrospective study of movement analysis was made using an automatic optical system (Facial Clima). Commissural excursion and commissural contraction velocity were also recorded. The mean age at reanimation was 43(8) years. The aetiology of the facial paralysis included acoustic neurinoma, fracture of the skull base, schwannoma of the facial nerve, resection of a cholesteatoma, and varicella zoster infection. The mean time duration of facial paralysis was 16(5) months. Follow-up was more than 2 years in all patients except 1 in whom it was 12 months. The mean duration to recovery of tone (as reported by the patient) was 67(11) days. Postoperative commissural excursion was 8(4)mm for the reanimated side and 8(3)mm for the healthy side (p=0.4). Likewise, commissural contraction velocity was 38(10)mm/s for the reanimated side and 43(12)mm/s for the healthy side (p=0.23). Mean percentage of recovery was 92(5)mm for commissural excursion and 79(15)mm/s for commissural contraction velocity.

Pub-med,Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer: a highly effective technique for facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma resection,"Background: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a new procedure for patients who acquire a proximal injury to the facial nerve. This article reports that this procedure is effective and associated with minimal morbidities. Methods: From November 2010 to February 2013, 16 patients underwent a masseter-to-facial nerve transfer. Their denervation periods varied from 2 to 18 months, with an average of 10.1¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±4.1 months. Their ages varied from 22 to 70 years, with an average of 34.7¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±15.4 years. The etiology of denervation was tumor resection in the cerebellopontine angle in all cases. All of the patients were followed up several times. The outcomes of the first follow-up at 3 months postoperatively and the last follow-up at a minimum 12 months postoperatively were documented. Using Terzis' and Metha's scales, the smile outcomes and synkinetic movements as visualized using standardized videos were graded preoperatively and postoperatively. The periods between the operation and the onset of mimetic muscle contraction were documented. A questionnaire was administered to evaluate the donor-site morbidity and the ability to smile without biting. Results: The final outcomes for smile function were as follows: 9 patients (56.3%) had excellent or good function, 5 patients (31.3%) had moderate function, and 2 patients (12.5%) had poor function. There was significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative time points and between the outcomes at the first and last follow-ups (P<0.05). Additionally, 13 (81.3%) patients had the ability to smile without biting 12 months postoperatively. The onset of muscle motion varied from 56 to 365 days and was positively correlated with age in the group of patients older than 40 years and negatively correlated with the outcome of the first follow-up. Four (25%) patients complained of concavity at the parotideomasseteric region, but none complained of disturbance in food intake. Synkinetic movements were observed in all patients and were rated as mild. Conclusions: The masseter-facial nerve transfer effectively reanimated the paralytic muscle in patients who acquired an intracranial facial nerve injury with minimal deficits at the donor site. After continued physical therapy, some patients were able to regain a symmetrical and effortless smile with mild synkinetic movements.",2,,0,0,1,9,2,2,0,10.1097/SAP.0000000000000246,Ann Plast Surg. 2014 Sep;73 Suppl 1:S63-9. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000000246.,"Wang W, Yang C, Li Q, Li W, Yang X, Zhang YX.",2014,25115378,"Tools: terzis' and Metha's scales Outlines: smile function, smile, synkinetic movements",16,3,12,Multiple nerve grafts:nerve transfer,,Masseteric nerve transfer,,,,,,

Objective: This paper aimed to address the ideal time for surgical intervention and the appropriate surgical approach for patients with facial paralysis resulting from temporal bone fractures. Methods: We retrospectively investigated 60 patients with facial paralysis due to temporal bone fractures who underwent facial nerve decompression via different operative approaches within 1 month after trauma, of which 48 were surgically treated by the middle cranial fossa approach (80%), 8 by a pure transmastoid approach (13.3%), and four by a combined transmastoid and middle cranial fossa approach (6.7%). The House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system was used to evaluate the recovery of facial nerve function. Results: The follow-up period for all the patients was 1 year.

Pub-med,Outcome-dependent coactivation of lip and tongue primary somatosensory representation following hypoglossal-facial transfer after peripheral facial palsy,"A hypoglossal-facial transfer is a common surgical strategy for reanimating the face after persistent total hemifacial palsy. We were interested in how motor recovery is associated with cortical reorganization of lip and tongue representation in the primary sensorimotor cortex after the transfer. Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 13 patients who underwent a hypoglossal-facial transfer after unilateral peripheral facial palsy. To identify primary motor and somatosensory tongue and lip representation sites, we measured repetitive tongue and lip movements during fMRI. Electromyography (EMG) of the perioral muscles during tongue and lip movements and standardized evaluation of lip elevation served as outcome parameters. We found an association of cortical representation sites in the pre- and postcentral gyrus (decreased distance of lip and tongue representation) with symmetry of recovered lip movements (lip elevation) and coactivation of the lip during voluntary tongue movements (EMG-activity of the lip during tongue movements). Overall, our study shows that hypoglossal-facial transfer resulted in an outcome-dependent cortical reorganization with activation of the cortical tongue area for restituded movement of the lip.",0,,0,0,0,1,8,2,0,10.1002/hbm.22206,Hum Brain Mapp. 2014 Feb;35(2):638-45. doi: 10.1002/hbm.22206.

Methods: Retrospective case review of 9 patients whose facial muscles were electrophysiologically proven to be reinnervated contralaterally. Results: The duration from symptom onset spanned from 3 to 114 months. All subjects had moderate-to-severe facial palsy initially. Contralateral reinnervation was observed in both traumatic and idiopathic causes, also in both complete and incomplete palsies. Cross-innervation is more frequently reported in muscles near the midline; however, this is the first report demonstrating evidence of cross-innervation in muscles far from the midline--the frontalis, the orbicularis oculi, and the zygomaticus. Conclusion: Although contralateral reinnervation after facial nerve palsy is a common observation, it has not gained appropriate attention. Without recognition of this phenomenon, misinterpretation of the electromyography may mislead the proper timing of nerve repair or reanimation procedure. Therefore, routine examination of motor action potential by contralateral stimulation during electromyography, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe palsy, would provide accurate assessment of the injured nerves and would help in appropriate decision making for further treatment.",0,,0,0,0,0,7,2,0,10.1097/MAO.0000000000000220,Otol Neurotol. 2014 Feb;35(2):e73-6. doi: 10.1097/MAO.0000000000000220.,"Yi Y, Jeong WJ, Kim W, Kim K.",2014,24317213,CMAP response,9,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

We present a case series of patients treated with gracilis muscle free flap with motor innervation by the masseteric nerve. We discuss the surgical technique and quantify the movement granted by the muscle, the improvement in quality of life and aesthetic results. Materials and methods: We report ten patients with unilateral facial paralysis who underwent free gracilis muscle flap, between the years 2010 and 2012 in two tertiary hospitals. Results: It is not reported any failure of the microsuture with survival of all flaps. The muscle movement was quantified by vectors at rest and contraction with an average of 1.7 cm that initiated around the fourth month after surgery. Patients also reported a significant improvement in symmetry at rest as well as oral and ocular competition. Conclusion: As currently presented in literature, microvascular free flaps are the technique of choice for facial reanimation.

Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: All patients who underwent nasolabial fold modification at our institution since July 2010 were included in our analysis. Patient demographics and characteristics of their facial paralysis were noted. Preoperative Facial Clinimetric Evaluation scores were compared with postoperative scores to quantify outcomes. Pre- and postoperative photos were then presented to an observer for ratings of overall miDFacial appearance. Results: Thirty-one patients were included in the review. Most of the patients were male. The average onset of paralysis was 50 years, and the average age at time of surgery was 61 years. The majority of patients had flaccid paralysis, with 10% of patients having synkinesis. Most patients presented with complaints of oral incompetence or drooling and generalized facial asymmetry. Facial Clinimetric Evaluation scores (P < .004) and overall miDFacial appearance (P < .05) improved significantly following surgery.

Pub-med,Facial synkinesia before and after surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face,"Background+C633: Facial synkinesia is a common sequela of facial palsy, affecting 15 to 20 percent of patients. The rate of postoperative synkinesia after facial reanimation is not clearly established. The severity and type of synkinesia determine the degree of clinical relevance. Methods: One hundred sixty-seven patients with facial palsy were included in this retrospective cohort study. Three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements was performed preoperatively and 18 months after facial reanimation. The severity of synkinesia was rated subjectively on a four-degree severity scale. Objective three-dimensional analysis of synkinesia was performed on patients with 18-month follow-up times. Results: Preoperatively, 84.4 percent of patients were not affected by synkinesia, 9 percent presented with mild synkinesia, 4.2 percent presented with moderate synkinesia, and 2.4 percent presented with severe synkinesia. Postoperatively, 51 percent of all patients presented with facial synkinesia (41.8 percent mild, 17.3 percent moderate, and 1 percent severe synkinesia; some patients had more than one type). Patients treated with territorially differentiated gracilis muscle transplantation were most frequently affected (69.8 percent), followed by patients treated with gracilis muscle transplantation in combination with temporalis muscle transposition to the eye (51.8 percent). Oculo-oral synkinesia was the most frequent form of synkinesia. Conclusions: After surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face, half of the patients presented with synkinesia. The majority of patients developed mild or moderate forms of synkinesia; therefore, the clinical relevance of synkinesia has to be seen in the context of total facial function. Because of the high prevalence of synkinesia, it should be documented and addressed in patients undergoing facial reanimation.

Materials and method: We applied the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale to 13 patients who underwent static reanimation because of facial palsies, both preoperatively and postoperatively, and results were compared statistically. The changes in nasal base angulation were recorded and compared based on the photographs of patients taken before and after the surgery. Results: Following the static reanimation operation, 76% (10/13) of the patients reported a subjective improvement in the nasal airflow, whereas 24% (3/13) did not report any change. Mean preoperative and postoperative NOSE scale scores were 66.92 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 9.90 and 36.15 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 9.61, respectively. The change in mean NOSE scale score was statistically significant (P < 0.001). In the preoperative and postoperative comparison of the photographs taken from the front view of the patients, a decreased nasal base angulation compared with preoperative period was detected in 8 (61.6%) patients. Conclusions: A statistically significant increase in subjective perception about nasal function was observed after the static facial reanimation; however, it is not certain whether this effect can be considered persistent.

Pub-med,Comparison of Direct Side-to-End and End-to-End Hypoglossal-Facial Anastomosis for Facial Nerve Repair,"Background: The hypoglossal facial anastomosis (HFA) is the gold standard for facial reanimation in patients with severe facial nerve palsy. The major drawbacks of the classic HFA technique are lingual morbidities due to hypoglossal nerve transection. The side-to-end HFA is a modification of the classic technique with fewer tongue-related morbidities. Objectives: In this study we compared the outcome of the classic end-to-end and the direct side-to-end HFA surgeries performed at our center in regards to the facial reanimation success rate and tongue-related morbidities. Methods: Twenty-six successive cases of HFA were enrolled. In 9 of them end-to-end anastomoses were performed, and 17 had direct side-to-end anastomoses. The House-Brackmann (HB) and Pitty and Tator (PT) scales were used to document surgical outcome. The hemiglossal atrophy, swallowing, and hypoglossal nerve function were assessed at follow-up. Results: The original pathology was vestibular schwannoma in 15, meningioma in 4, brain stem glioma in 4, and other pathologies in 3. The mean interval between facial palsy and HFA was 18 months (range: 0-60). The median follow-up period was 20 months. The PT grade at follow-up was worse in patients with a longer interval from facial palsy and HFA (P value: 0.041). The lesion type was the only other factor that affected PT grade (the best results in vestibular schwannoma and the worst in the other pathologies group, P value: 0.038). The recovery period for facial tonicity was longer in patients with radiation therapy before HFA (13.5 vs. 8.5 months) and those with a longer than 2-year interval from facial palsy to HFA (13.5 vs. 8.5 months). Although no significant difference between the side-to-end and the end-to-end groups was seen in terms of facial nerve functional recovery, patients from the side-to-end group had a significantly lower rate of lingual morbidities (tongue hemiatrophy: 100% vs. 5.8%, swallowing difficulty: 55% vs. 11.7%, speech disorder 33% vs. 0%). Conclusion: With the side-to-end HFA technique the functional restoration outcome is at least as good as that following the classic end-to-end HFA, but the complications related to the complete hypoglossal nerve transection can be avoided. Best results are achieved if this procedure is performed within the first 2 years after facial nerve injury. Patients with facial palsy of longer duration also have the chance for good functional restoration after HFA.",3,,0,0,0,5,2,1,0,10.1016/j.wneu.2015.03.029,World Neurosurg. 2015 Aug;84(2):368-75. doi: 10.1016/j.wneu.2015.03.029.

Pub-med,Modified technique for rehabilitation of facial paralysis using autogenous fascia lata grafts,"Purpose: In this retrospective study we used a modified surgical technique for miDFace reanimation in patients with facial nerve paralysis. Facial atonicity can cause functional impairment regarding speech articulation, oral competence, breathing, and eyelid closure. Furthermore, esthetic and psychological aspects play an important role in patients' emotional interaction and social integration. The chosen rehabilitative technique should offer support against prolapse of facial structures and remedy of functional disabilities and, thereby, prevention of social stigmatization due to disease-related changes in appearance. Materials and methods: Between 2005 and 2013, fascia lata grafts were used as static support in 15 cases of unilateral facial paralysis. Two fascia lata grafts were subcutaneously inserted in the upper and lower lips crossing the midline and sutured at 4 points, including the unaffected part of the orbicularis oris muscle and modiolus. The slings were suspended against the zygomatic arch with an osteosynthesis plate. Results: The patients perceived surgery results as considerably improving their appearance, speech, and alimentation. In 93.3% of cases, no postoperative complications occurred. The follow-up results (8 months to 8 years) remained stable. Conclusions: This retrospective study showed the advantages of static facial reanimation in appropriate cases. The bony fixated support of the fascial slings allows an immediate improvement of facial symmetry. Additional attachment points including the unaffected part of the orbicularis oris muscle and the use of 2 independent fascia lata slings allow a more accurate adjustment of suspension forces and an incomplete dynamic reanimation of the mouth corner. With respect to its simplicity and minimal invasiveness, this surgical procedure is associated with low morbidity and rapid improvement of the patient's esthetic appearance.",0,,2,3,5,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.joms.2014.07.041,J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2015 Jan;73(1):176-83. doi: 10.1016/j.joms.2014.07.041.

Pub-med,Electromyographic Evaluation of Temporalis Muscle Following Temporalis Tendon Transfer (Facial Reanimation) Surgery,"Facial paralysis is a significant functional and aesthetic handicap. Many techniques have been defined for facial reanimation. The aim of the study was to evaluate postoperative electromyographical (EMG) activity of temporalis muscle to assess the potential neural impairments related to the surgical procedure. Methodology: Four patients with facial paralysis were operated with the temporalis muscle tendon transfer technique. Simultaneous surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity at first postoperative year from the bilateral temporalis and masseter muscles was obtained at mandibular rest position and then during maximal clenching. Results: Patients were followed for a minimum period of 18 months. Surface electromyographic evaluations during passive state revealed similar values for the operated and contralateral side. Measurements during active ""clench-smiling"" of the jaw revealed similar amplitudes for both muscles of the operated side in all cases except case #2. Case #2 revealed lower values for both measurements of temporalis and masseter muscles of the operated side compared with the contralateral side. Dissonant results of case #2 can be the consequence of impaired temporalis muscle activity because of the tension on the muscle as a consequence of overcorrection. Conclusion:Temporalis muscle transfer to the perioral region does not hinder contractility of the muscle as long as the facial deformity is not overcorrected.",0,,0,3,0,7,6,2,0,10.1097/SCS.0000000000002027,J Craniofac Surg. 2015 Sep;26(6):e515-7. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000002027.,"Ozturan O, Ozucer B, Gursoy AE.",2015,26267582,Tools: sEMG Outcomes: comparisson between EMG values between hemifaces,4,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Postparalysis facial synkinesis: clinical classification and surgical strategies,"Background: Postparalysis facial synkinesis (PPFS) can occur after any cause of facial palsy. Current treatments are still inadequate. Surgical intervention, instead of Botox and rehabilitation only, for different degrees of PPFS was proposed. Methods: Seventy patients (43 females and 27 males) with PPFS were enrolled since 1986. They were divided into 4 patterns based on quality of smile and severity of synkinesis. Data collection for clinically various presentations was made: pattern I (n = 14) with good smile but synkinesis, pattern II (n = 17) with acceptable smile but dominant synkinesis, pattern III (n = 34) unacceptable smile and dominant synkinesis, and pattern IV (n = 5) poor smile and synkinesis. Surgical interventions were based on patterns of PPFS. Selective myectomy and some cosmetic procedures were performed for pattern I and II patients. Extensive myectomy and neurectomy of the involved muscles and nerves followed by functioning free-muscle transplantation for facial reanimation in 1- or 2-stage procedure were performed for pattern III and many pattern II patients. A classic 2-stage procedure for facial reanimation was performed for pattern IV patients. Results: Minor aesthetic procedures provided some help to pattern I patients but did not cure the problem. They all had short follow-up. Most patients in patterns II (14/17, 82%) and III (34/34, 100%) showed a significant improvement of eye and smile appearance and significant decrease in synkinetic movements following the aggressively major surgical intervention. Nearly, all of the patients treated by the authors did not need repeated botulinum toxin A injection nor require a profound rehabilitation program in the follow-up period. Conclusions: Treatment of PPFS remains a challenging problem. Major surgical reconstruction showed more promising and long-lasting results than botulinum toxin A and/or rehabilitation on pattern III and II patients.",0,,1,0,1,9,2,3,1,10.1097/GOX.0000000000000283,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open. 2015 Apr 7;3(3):e320. doi: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000000283. eCollection 2015 Mar.,"Chuang DC, Chang TN, Lu JC.",2015,25878931,"Tools: Smiling Score, Cortical Adaptation Stage System, Synkinesis Gradeing System, Satisfactory Score Outcomes: eye and smile appearance, sykinetic movements multiple types of free flaps",70,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Transnasal tendon suspension for the paralyzed lower eyelid,"Background: Paralytic ectropion is a significantly functional and esthetic problem leading to problems with lacrimation, corneal exposure, and poor palpebral closure. Limitations with traditional corrective procedures include poor apposition of the lid to the globe, suboptimal medial canthal position, and high recurrence rates. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a technique of lower-lid suspension using transnasal wiring for the long-term maintenance of lid position. Methods: Twenty-three consecutive patients with complete unilateral facial nerve paralysis underwent the procedure, and they were followed up for a median of 27 months (1-73 months). Results: Fifteen of 18 patients maintained their intraoperative lower-lid position beyond the 12-month follow-up. Three patients had a minimal scleral show at 3 months.

Pub-med,Double innervated free functional muscle transfer for facial reanimation,"Background: The treatment of long-standing facial palsy represents a challenge for the reconstructive surgeon. Treatment is based on dynamic procedures such as functional muscle flaps. The benefit of added axonal load has recently been reported. This study describes a two stage technique involving dual innervation of a gracilis muscle flap with initial cross-facial nerve graft (CFNG) followed by free muscle transfer co-apted to both the CFNG and a masseter nerve for facial reanimation. Methods: A total of nine patients from August 2008-July 2011 were operated on with the double innervated gracilis muscle flap. Pre- and postoperative electromyography was documented, and video analysis with the five-stage classification of reanimation outcomes was performed. Results: All patients recovered voluntary and spontaneous smile abilities, with an average of 70% motor unit recruitment. Based on the Terzis reanimation outcome classification, four patients had an excellent result, four good, and one moderate. Conclusions: The double innervated gracilis muscle flap is a viable technique for the treatment of long-standing facial palsy.

Pub-med,"End-to-side ""loop"" graft for total facial nerve reconstruction: Over 10 years experience","Background: Multiple-branch reconstruction is required in order to attain facial reanimation for extensive facial nerve defects. We previously reported that end-to-side nerve grafting, with the use of a single nerve graft for defect reconstruction, was easy to perform. We have also demonstrated the efficacy of end-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve to the donor graft nerve, in experimental rat models and clinical cases. The regenerating axons, which extended into the nerve graft, were ""distributed"" to multiple recipient nerves via end-to-side nerve-suture sites. Methods: Thirty-two patients who underwent facial nerve reconstruction (five to 10 branches) had a single sural nerve graft coapted to the proximal stump of the facial nerve in an end-to-end manner, followed by end-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve stumps to the side of the nerve graft. In 19 patients who were expected to undergo postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, the distal end of the graft was connected to the side of the hypoglossal nerve for ""axonal supercharging,"" to enhance the recovery of the facial muscles. Results: Initial facial movements were noted at 5-12 months postoperatively, and good recovery (House-Brackmann grade III/IV) was observed during long-term follow-up in most patients. Conclusion: End-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve stumps to the nerve graft requires less graft nerve material and less technical mastery to reconstruct multiple branches of the facial nerve. We also described the concept of ""axonal supercharging,"" namely the connection of double-donor neural sources to the graft, and ""axonal distribution,"" namely the reinnervation of multiple recipient nerve stumps connected to the graft in an end-to-side manner. This combination of axonal supercharging and distribution can be a useful option in facial nerve reconstruction.",3,,0,0,1,7,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2015.04.005,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2015 Aug;68(8):1054-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2015.04.005.

Pub-med,One-stage dual latissimus dorsi muscle flap transfer with a pair of vascular anastomoses and double nerve suturing for long-standing facial paralysis,"Objective: Various types of neurovascular free-muscle transfers have been reported as surgical treatments for long-standing facial paralysis. Among one-stage methods, two approaches, that is, latissimus dorsi transfer with nerve suturing to the contralateral facial nerve and gracilis transfer with nerve suturing to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve, have recently become popular. The former method has the advantage of making spontaneous smiling possible, but the contraction strength of the transferred muscle varies, whereas the latter approach has the advantage of guaranteeing voluntary contraction of the transferred muscle, but makes spontaneous smiling difficult. Recently, dual innervation methods have also been reported, but uncertainty remains about the utility of such approaches. To overcome these drawbacks, we devised a hybrid method combining the two previously established techniques. Methods: Two latissimus dorsi muscle flaps containing the thoracodorsal vessels from one side are transferred with a pair of vascular anastomoses. The true trunk of the thoracodorsal nerve, which innervates one of the muscle flaps, is sutured to the contralateral facial nerve, while the short branch of the thoracodorsal nerve, which innervates the other muscle flap, is sutured to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. From November 2011 to October 2013, we used this method in four patients with long-standing facial paralysis. Results: Smiling was assessed in the three patients who were followed up for more than 1 year, and satisfactory results were obtained (Harii score: 4-5). In one patient, the movement mediated via the contralateral facial nerve was a little weak, but this was compensated for by the muscles controlled by the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Conclusion: Our novel one-stage method, which involves a combination of two previously established methods, guarantees early voluntary smiling, and spontaneous smiling becomes possible later. In addition, it is free from the uncertainty associated with double innervation and does not require nerve grafts. So, stable results can be expected in most patients with long-standing facial paralysis.",6,"Masseteric + Thoracodorsal, CFNG + Thoracodorsal",1,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2015.02.013,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2015 Jun;68(6):e113-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2015.02.013.

Pub-med,[Rehabilitation of facial paralysis using autogenous fascia lata graft. Stable results over time],"Dynamic facial reanimation with free muscle or nerve transfers represents the mainstay of facial paralysis treatments particularly for perioral area and smile. These techniques are not always feasible, in such cases we perform a perioral suspension with fascia lata graft. However many teams blame this technique for short-term recurrence of the deformity. We describe in this paper details of our surgical technique, to improve the aesthetic result and stability over time, and the results and complications encountered. Fascia lata graft was sutured beyond the midline to the contralateral healthy lips, after tunneling through upper and lower orbicularis oris. Fascia lata graft was then tunneled through the buccal fat pad, then under the zygomatic arch to the temporal region, where the temporal aponeurosis was incised to make way for the fascia lata graft, which was fixed to the outer face of the temporal aponeurosis, applying slight overcorrection to the oral commissure. From 2003 to 2012, we performed this procedure on 8 patients. Results showed an immediate aesthetic improvement, stable over time.

Pub-med,Intrinsic facial nerve tumours of the temporal bone: a proposed management guideline,"Objective: The aim of this paper was to propose a guideline for the management of intrinsic facial nerve tumours based on our practice and findings in the literature. Method: A retrospective review of intrinsic facial nerve tumours over the last 15 years was performed. Parameters measured included age, presenting symptoms, pre- and post-treatment hearing and House-Brackmann grading, tumour position, treatment and duration of follow up. Results: A total of 15 patients presented with intrinsic facial nerve tumours over the study period. The most common presenting complaint was facial symptoms (93.3 per cent), followed by hearing loss (46.7 per cent). Three patients with stable facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grades II-III) were treated conservatively. Twelve patients underwent surgery to treat progressive or recurrent symptoms. Facial function was maintained or improved in 60.0 per cent of patients and hearing was preserved in 66.7 per cent. Conclusion: We propose that all stable tumours associated with good facial function of grade III or below should be treated conservatively. For symptomatic or progressive lesions, tailored surgery depending on the tumour site and hearing level should be offered to preserve native nerve function and facial musculature. For patients with prolonged paralysis, tumours can be monitored and other forms of facial reanimation and support offered.",0,,0,0,9,7,8,3,0,10.1017/S0022215115000572,J Laryngol Otol. 2015 May;129(5):445-9. doi: 10.1017/S0022215115000572.

Pub-med,Bidirectional/double fascia grafting for simple and semi-dynamic reconstruction of lower lip deformity in facial paralysis,"Background: For the total aesthetic reconstruction of facial paralysis, treatment of lower lip deformity as ""a neglected target in facial reanimation"" is important. Although various dynamic reconstruction approaches have been reported for lower lip deformity, these have not been popularly performed due to aggressive surgical invasiveness, long recovery time for reinnervation, and unstable outcomes. To reconstruct the lower lip deformity more simply but semi-dynamically, we modified bidirectional/double fascia grafting methods that have been established as simple and minimally invasive treatments for pediatric congenital lower lip paralysis. Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, nine patients were treated using this procedure alone or with combinations of other procedures of facial reanimation such as one-stage free muscle transfer. For outcome assessment, patients were evaluated using a lower lip paralysis grading system, including the objective aesthetics and functional results of the lower lip at rest (score range, 0-1), during smiling (score range, 0-4), and during mouth opening (score range, 0-2). Results: The mean total scores improved from 1.43 (poor) preoperatively to 5.71 (excellent) postoperatively. In all evaluation items, the postoperative scores improved significantly compared to the preoperative scores (p<0.01) with no severe complications. Conclusions: The procedure is simply applied to various types of extensive facial paralysis, as well as congenital lower lip paralysis in combination with other static and dynamic reconstruction methods for facial paralysis, and it is suggested that this approach significantly and semi-dynamically improves the aesthetic function of the lower lip at rest, during smiling, and during mouth opening.",0,,2,1,9,9,8,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.044,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2015 Mar;68(3):321-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.044.

Pub-med,The degree of facial movement following microvascular muscle transfer in pediatric facial reanimation depends on donor motor nerve axonal density,"Background: Free functional muscle transfer to the face is a standard of facial animation. The contralateral facial nerve, via a cross-face nerve graft, provides spontaneous innervation for the transferred muscle, but is not universally available and has additional shortcomings. The motor nerve to the masseter provides an alternative innervation source. In this study, the authors compared donor nerve histomorphometry and clinical outcomes in a single patient population undergoing free muscle transfer to the face. Methods: Pediatric patients undergoing dynamic facial (re-)animation with intraoperative nerve biopsies and gracilis transfer to the face powered by either the contralateral facial nerve via a cross-face nerve graft or the motor nerve to the masseter were reviewed over a 7-year period. Myelinated nerve counts were assessed histomorphometrically, and functional outcomes were evaluated with the Scaled Measurement of Improvement in Lip Excursion software. Results: From 2004 to 2011, 91 facial (re-)animation procedures satisfied study inclusion criteria. Average myelinated fiber counts were 6757 per mm2 in the donor facial nerve branch, 1647 per mm in the downstream cross-face nerve graft at the second stage, and 5289 per mm in the masseteric nerve. Reconstructions with either innervation source resulted in improvements in oral commissure excursion and smile symmetry, with the greatest amounts of oral commissure excursion noted in the masseteric nerve group. Conclusions: Facial (re-)animation procedures with use of the cross-face nerve graft or masseteric nerve are effective and result in symmetric smiles. The masseteric nerve provides a more robust innervation source and results in greater commissure excursion.

Pub-med,How to rehabilitate long-term facial paralysis,"Objective: To project the surgical resuscitation methods that we apply to the lower part of the face and the eyes with the aim of preventing functional and psychological problems that can occur in patients with facial paralysis. Materials and methods: Twenty-two patients with facial nerve paralysis due to acoustic neuroma, trauma, cholesteatoma, and parotid carcinoma were included in this study. In the lower facial region, the temporal muscle was suspended to the lower lip. In the upper facial region, eyelid gold implantation was performed. The reanimation results of the upper and lower facial regions were graded as excellent, good, fair, and poor in consideration of the symmetry after rest and smile according to May classification in the third month after the surgery. Results: The study group comprised 15 men (68.2%) and 5 women (31.8 %) (mean age, 63.82 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 14.18 years; range, 8-78 years). Of the patients, 18.2% (n = 4) had acoustic neuroma, 40.9% (n = 9) had facial trauma, 27.3% (n = 6) had cholesteatoma, and 13.6% (n = 3) had parotid carcinoma.Reanimation techniques were applied to 40.9% (n = 9) of the patients during the first 2-4 years, whereas 59.1% (n = 13) of patients underwent surgery after 4 years.In a total of 17 patients (77.3%) who had lower lip intervention, 4 patients (23.5%) had excellent results, 7 patients (41.2%) had good results, and 6 patients (35.3%) had moderate results.In the 22 patients who underwent the eyelid procedure, 5 patients (22.7 %) had excellent results, 13 patients (59.1 %) had good results, and 3 patients (18.2 %) had moderate results. Poor results were not observed in any patient. Conclusion: Facial paralysis is a disease that causes serious functional and psychological problems in patients. Therefore, the choice of treatment method is dependent on the etiology, duration of paralysis, expectations of the patient, and experience of the surgeon. Being less invasive methods, obtaining immediate results, requiring single surgical stage, and having long-lasting results and dynamic muscle transfer and static suspension methods are preferred.",0,,0,3,10,9,2,1,0,10.1097/SCS.0000000000001571,J Craniofac Surg. 2015 May;26(3):831-5. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000001571.,"Kumral TL, Uyar Y, Berkiten G, Mutlu AT, Ata‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚à´ E, S‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•nnet‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚à´i G, Yildirim G.",2015,25915681,"Tools: May's classification ""eyelid gold"" implantation also performed Negative Outcomes: inflammation Positive Outcomes: symmetry, complete eye-closure",17,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Epidemiologic Overview of Synkinesis in 353 Patients with Longstanding Facial Paralysis under Treatment with Botulinum Toxin for 11 Years,"Background: Patients with longstanding facial paralysis often exhibit synkinesis. Few reports describe the prevalence and factors related to the development of synkinesis after facial paralysis. Botulinum toxin type A injection is an important adjunct treatment for facial paralysis-induced asymmetry and synkinesis. The authors assessed the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with sequelae of facial paralysis treated with botulinum toxin type A injections to evaluate the prevalence of synkinesis and related factors. Methods: A total of 353 patients (age, 4 to 84 years; 245 female patients) with longstanding facial paralysis underwent 2312 botulinum toxin type A injections during an 11-year follow-up. Doses used over the years, previous treatments (electrical stimulation, operations), and how they correlated to postparalysis and postreanimation synkinesis were analyzed. Results: There was a significant association between cause and surgery. Most patients with facial paralysis caused by a congenital defect, trauma, or a tumor underwent reanimation. There were no sex- or synkinesis-related differences in the doses used, but the doses were higher in the reanimation group than in the no-surgery group. Synkinesis was found in 196 patients; 148 (41.9 percent) presented with postparalysis synkinesis (oro-ocular, oculo-oral) and 58 (16.4 percent) presented with postreanimation synkinesis. Ten patients presented with both types. Conclusions: This study determined the high prevalence (55.5 percent) of synkinesis in patients with longstanding facial paralysis. Postparalysis synkinesis was positively associated with infectious and idiopathic causes, electrical stimulation, facial nerve decompression, and no requirement for surgery. Postreanimation synkinesis was present in 28.2 percent of reanimated patients and was significantly associated with microsurgical flaps, transfacial nerve grafting, masseteric-facial anastomosis, and temporalis muscle transfers.",4,,0,1,1,0,4,1,1,10.1097/PRS.0000000000001802,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2015 Dec;136(6):1289-1298. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000001802.,"Salles AG, da Costa EF, Ferreira MC, do Nascimento Remigio AF, Moraes LB, Gemperli R.",2015,26595022,,196,,,"Other type of nerve graft: masseteric, cross facial ",,Masseteric nerve transfer,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,
Pub-med,Lengthening temporalis myoplasty and facial paralysis from birth,"Introduction: Congenital facial paralysis (FP) is present from birth. It can produce major esthetic and functional disorders. It can be from two different etiologies: developmental and acquired. There is no curative treatment for congenital FP and the aim for the plastic surgeon is to restore a smile as symmetrical and as dynamic as possible. For this, two opposite techniques can be used: muscular free flaps and locoregional flaps whose lengthening temporalis myoplasty. Materiel and methods: We report our series of 34 congenital FP patients who were operated by lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM). We divided the patients into three categories: acquired FP (11 cases), isolated developmental FP (13 cases), and syndromic developmental FP (10 cases). The evaluation of the smile is based on the quality of the commissural course compared to the healthy side and the spontaneity of it. Results: In the acquired FP group, 100% obtained a spontaneous smile with a postoperative delay of 9.5 months, 12 of the 13 cases of isolated developmental FP (92.7%) after 7.3 months postoperatively, and finally, in the 10 cases of syndromic FP, nine (90%) had a spontaneous smile after 9.7 months. Discussion: Muscular free flaps continue to be the gold standard for the reanimation of smile on the FP. To our knowledge, no articles comparing smile restoration using free flap and smile restoration using LTM exist. A comparison of the success rates from different studies shows that both these techniques yield good results and can be used for smile restoration in FP. This technique is faster and easier than a free flap and has a same result, which is why we consider this technique as a reference on smile reanimation in FP.",0,,2,1,5,2,4,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.039,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2015 Mar;68(3):312-20. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.039.

Pub-med,Facial paralysis grading system: a new and simple smile excursion score for evaluating facial reanimation surgery,"Background: Various facial paralysis grading systems have been introduced to evaluate the results of both spontaneous recovery and facial palsy reconstruction. The aim of the present study was to introduce and evaluate an objective new and quick Smile Excursion Score system which is readily applicable and easy to follow. It has been applied over the past 25 years for preoperative and postoperative result evaluation of smile reconstruction at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Methods: A standardized evaluation method was described for the assessment of the upper lip movement preoperatively and postoperatively with at least 1 year follow-up after functioning muscle transplantation. The evaluation was scored by the number of maxillary teeth exposed when smiling with teeth showing. Reliability of this technique was assessed by using 3 independent examiners who each evaluated the smiles of 34 unilateral facial paralysis patients 4 times, creating 408 sets of measurements. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients for interrater and intrarater reliability exceeded 0.94, which is considered as excellent and reliable.

Pub-med,Masseteric nerve transfer for short-term facial paralysis following skull base surgery,"Background: Nerve transfers have been widely used to reanimate paralyzed facial muscles after irreversible proximal injuries to the facial nerve. The author has developed a technique involving masseteric nerve transfer combined with cross-facial nerve grafting for treating skull base surgery-induced facial paralysis. This paper aims to demonstrate that this procedure is effective and causes negligible donor site morbidity. Methods: Seven patients who developed facial paralysis after the removal of skull base tumors were treated with masseteric nerve transfer combined with cross-facial nerve grafting with the aim of reanimating the miDFace. The mean period of preoperative paralysis was 6 months. The follow-up period ranged from 22 to 65 months (mean: 46 months). The patients were evaluated with physical examinations and video analysis. Results: Successful reanimation of the miDFace was achieved in all patients except one, whose muscle tone recovered. On average, facial motion developed 4 months after the nerve transfer. Only minimal coordinated eyelid movement was seen during biting. None of the patients experienced impaired masticatory function or visible wasting of the masseter muscle. All of the patients who recovered the ability to contract their paralyzed muscles were able to close their eyes tightly during biting; however, none of the patients have been able to achieve an effortless spontaneous smile. Conclusions: Masseteric nerve transfer is an alternative method for selective reanimation of the miDFace and does not cause donor site morbidity.",4,,0,0,10,9,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2015.02.031,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2015 Jun;68(6):764-70. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2015.02.031.

Pub-med,Differential Reanimation of the Upper and Lower Face Using 2 Interpositional Nerve Grafts in Total Facial Nerve Reconstruction,"Radical parotidectomy often results in complex facial nerve defects involving the main nerve trunk and multiple distal nerve branches. Although cable nerve grafting often leads to good nerve regeneration, severe synkinesis due to aberrant axonal regrowth is inevitable. In such situations, the use of 2 motor sources to differentially reanimate the upper and lower face could minimize synkinesis. Here we describe a method of total facial nerve reconstruction in which the upper and lower face are differentially reconstructed with the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerve, respectively, using 2 interpositional nerve grafts. Reconstruction of the lower face with the facial nerve restored voluntary and coordinated animation, and reconstruction of the upper face with the hypoglossal nerve restored frontalis muscle tone and eye closure. These results suggest that our method could serve as an alternative to conventional techniques that use only the facial or hypoglossal nerve.",3,,0,0,1,2,4,1,0,10.1097/GOX.0000000000000530,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open. 2015 Oct 23;3(10):e544. doi: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000000530. eCollection 2015 Oct.,"Tomita K, Nishibayashi A, Yano K, Hosokawa K.",2015,26579350,,1,,,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Double-powered free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation: A longitudinal optoelectronic study,"The choice of the motor donor nerve is a crucial point in free flap transfer algorithms. In the case of unilateral facial paralysis, the contralateral healthy facial nerve can provide coordinated smile animation and spontaneous emotional expression, but with unpredictable axonal ingrowth into the recipient muscle. Otherwise, the masseteric nerve ipsilateral to the paralysis can provide a powerful neural input, without a spontaneous trigger of the smile. Harvesting a bulky muscular free flap may enhance the quantity of contraction but esthetic results are unpleasant. Therefore, the logical solution for obtaining high amplitude of smiling combined with spontaneity of movement is to couple the neural input: the contralateral facial nerve plus the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Thirteen patients with unilateral dense facial paralysis underwent a one-stage facial reanimation with a gracilis flap powered by a double donor neural input, provided by both the ipsilateral masseteric nerve (coaptation by an end-to-end neurorrhaphy with the obturator nerve) and the contralateral facial nerve (coaptation through a cross-face nerve graft: end-to-end neurorrhaphy on the healthy side and end-to-side neurorrhaphy on the obturator nerve, distal to the masseteric/obturator neurorrhaphy). Their facial movements were evaluated with an optoelectronic motion analyzer. Before surgery, on average, the paretic side exhibited a smaller total three-dimensional mobility than the healthy side, with a 52% activation ratio and >30% of asymmetry. After surgery, the differences significantly decreased (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p < 0.05), with an activation ratio between 75% (maximum smile) and 91% (maximum smile with teeth clenching), and <20% of asymmetry. Similar modifications were seen for the performance of spontaneous smiles. The significant presurgical asymmetry of labial movements reduced after surgery. The use of a double donor neural input permitted both movements that were similar in force to that of the healthy side, and spontaneous movements elicited by emotional triggering.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,0,3,2,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2015.03.029,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2015 Jul;68(7):930-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2015.03.029.

Pub-med,A new paradigm in facial reanimation for long-standing palsies?,"Background: A chance observation of return of excellent facial movement, after 18 months following the first stage of cross-face nerve grafting, without free functional muscle transfer, in a case of long-standing facial palsy, lead the senior author (RBA) to further investigate clinically. Patients and methods: This procedure, now christened as cross-face nerve extension and neurotization, was carried out in 12 patients of very long-standing facial palsy (mean 21 years) in years 1996-2011. The mean patient age and duration of palsy were 30.58 years and 21.08 years, respectively. In patients, 1-5 a single buccal or zygomatic branch served as a donor nerve, but subsequently, we used two donor nerves. The mean follow-up period was 20.75 months. Results: Successive patients had excellent to good return of facial expression with two fair results. Besides improved smile, patients could largely retain air in the mouth without any escape and had improved mastication. No complications were encountered except synkinesis in 1 patient. No additional surgical procedures were performed. Conclusion: There is experimental evidence to suggest that neurotization of a completely denervated muscle can occur by the formation of new ectopic motor end plates. Long-standing denervated muscle fibres eventually atrophy severely but are capable of re-innervation and regeneration, as validated by electron microscopic studies. In spite of several suggestions in the literature to clinically validate functional recovery by direct neurotization, the concept remains anecdotal. Our results substantiate this procedure, and it has the potential to simplify reanimation in longstanding facial palsy. Our work now needs validation by other investigators in the field of restoring facial animation.",1,,0,0,1,9,4,1,0,10.4103/0970-0358.155265,Indian J Plast Surg. 2015 Jan-Apr;48(1):30-7. doi: 10.4103/0970-0358.155265.,"Ahuja RB, Chatterjee P, Gupta R, Shrivastava P, Gupta GK.",2015,25991883,pos: improved smile and mastication,12,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Single-stage dynamic reanimation of the smile in irreversible facial paralysis by free functional muscle transfer,"Unilateral facial paralysis is a common disease that is associated with significant functional, aesthetic and psychological issues. Though idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) is the most common diagnosis, patients can also present with a history of physical trauma, infectious disease, tumor, or iatrogenic facial paralysis. Early repair within one year of injury can be achieved by direct nerve repair, cross-face nerve grafting or regional nerve transfer. It is due to muscle atrophy that in long lasting facial paralysis complex reconstructive methods have to be applied. Instead of one single procedure, different surgical approaches have to be considered to alleviate the various components of the paralysis. The reconstruction of a spontaneous dynamic smile with a symmetric resting tone is a crucial factor to overcome the functional deficits and the social handicap that are associated with facial paralysis. Although numerous surgical techniques have been described, a two-stage approach with an initial cross-facial nerve grafting followed by a free functional muscle transfer is most frequently applied. In selected patients however, a single-stage reconstruction using the motor nerve to the masseter as donor nerve is superior to a two-stage repair. The gracilis muscle is most commonly used for reconstruction, as it presents with a constant anatomy, a simple dissection and minimal donor site morbidity. Here we demonstrate the pre-operative work-up, the post-operative management, and precisely describe the surgical procedure of single-stage microsurgical reconstruction of the smile by free functional gracilis muscle transfer in a step by step protocol. We further illustrate common pitfalls and provide useful tips which should enable the reader to truly comprehend the procedure. We further discuss indications and limitations of the technique and demonstrate representative results.",1,,1,0,0,2,8,3,0,10.3791/52386,J Vis Exp. 2015 Mar 1;(97):52386. doi: 10.3791/52386.,"Thiele J, Bannasch H, Stark GB, Eisenhardt SU.",2015,25868011,,5,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Masseteric-facial nerve transposition for reanimation of the smile in incomplete facial paralysis,"Incomplete f+C636acial paralysis occurs in about a third of patients with Bell's palsy. Although their faces are symmetrical at rest, when they smile they have varying degrees of disfigurement. Currently, cross-face nerve grafting is one of the most useful techniques for reanimation. Transfer of the masseteric nerve, although widely used for complete paralysis, has not to our knowledge been reported for incomplete palsy. Between December 2008 and November 2013, we reanimated the faces of 9 patients (2 men and 7 women) with incomplete unilateral facial paralysis with transposition of the masseteric nerve. Sex, age at operation, cause of paralysis, duration of denervation, recipient nerves used, and duration of follow-up were recorded. Commissural excursion, velocity, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated with the FACIAL CLIMA and a questionnaire, respectively. The mean (SD) age at operation was 39 (¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±6) years and the duration of denervation was 29 (¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±19) months. There were no complications that required further intervention. Duration of follow-up ranged from 6-26 months. FACIAL CLIMA showed improvement in both commissural excursion and velocity of more than two thirds in 6 patients, more than one half in 2 patients and less than one half in one. Qualitative evaluation showed a slight or pronounced improvement in 7/9 patients. The masseteric nerve is a reliable alternative for reanimation of the smile in patients with incomplete facial paralysis. Its main advantages include its consistent anatomy, a one-stage operation, and low morbidity at the donor site.",2,,0,0,4,9,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjoms.2015.06.011,Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2015 Dec;53(10):943-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bjoms.2015.06.011.

Pub-med,Spontaneity of smile after facial paralysis rehabilitation when using a non-facial donor nerve,"Introduction: The current focus in dynamic reanimation of facial paralysis lies not only in restoring movement but also regaining smile spontaneity. It has been argued that a spontaneous smile can only be achieved using the contralateral facial nerve as donor via cross-face nerve grafting. Techniques based on the motor nerve to the masseter, however, have shown good rates of spontaneity as well. Patients and methods: Patients with complete facial paralysis reanimated using free gracilis to masseteric nerve or masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer were included. Patients were grouped according to gender comparing the rates of spontaneous smile. Results: Thirty-six patients (17 women and 19 men) underwent gracilis innervated by the masseteric nerve whereas masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer was performed in 30 cases (14 women and 16 men). For both techniques, women showed significantly higher rates of spontaneity. Additionally, women recovered spontaneity earlier than men. Conclusions: Along with providing a strong and reliable commissural pull, the motor nerve to the masseter is able to restore spontaneity as well. Women seem more prone to achieving it. Brain plasticity and the close relationship between the cortical areas of the masseteric and facial nerves are most likely the mechanisms underlying smile spontaneity.",4,,1,0,0,2,8,1,0,10.1016/j.jcms.2016.06.031,J Craniomaxillofac Surg. 2016 Sep;44(9):1305-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jcms.2016.06.031.

Objective: To evaluate the use of the pattern of facial paralysis recovery in the early postoperative months as a sole predictor in selecting patients for facial nerve grafting after CPA tumor resection when cranial nerve VII is uninterrupted. Design, setting, and participants: Sixty-two patients with facial paralysis and uninterrupted cranial nerve VII who developed facial paralysis after CPA tumor resection at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were followed up prospectively to assess for spontaneous recovery and to determine candidacy for facial reanimation surgery. The study dates and dates of analysis were January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2015. Interventions: After a minimum of 6 months of clinical follow-up and no signs of clinical recovery, patients underwent facial nerve exploration and a masseteric or hypoglossal nerve transfer. Intraoperative direct nerve stimulation was performed to assess for the presence of subclinical reinnervation. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 18 months after surgery to evaluate outcomes. Main outcomes and measures: Facial function and recovery were studied objectively with a Smile Recovery Scale, Facial Asymmetry Index, and House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. Other outcome measures included the duration of paralysis, time to recovery, and evidence of synkinesis. Results: Sixty-two patients (33 men, 29 women; mean age 51.8 years) with uninterrupted facial nerves after CPA tumor resection developed HB grade IV, V, or VI facial paralysis. Ten patients underwent nerve grafting by 12 months, 9 patients received grafting after 12 months, and 8 patients had no intervention. Thirty-five patients spontaneously recovered. In all patients who underwent nerve grafting, there were no detectable facial muscle movements or electromyographic response to direct facial nerve stimulation suggestive of occult reinnervation. Overall, early facial reanimation surgery resulted in a shorter total duration of paralysis. Masseteric nerve grafting resulted in earlier recovery compared with hypoglossal nerve grafting (5.6 vs 10.8 months, P = .005). Patients who showed no signs of recovery by 6 months after CPA surgery but declined facial reanimation surgery demonstrated at best HB grade V recovery after 18 months of observation. Conclusions and relevance: The recovery pattern in the early postoperative period among patients who develop facial paralysis after CPA tumor resection is a useful clinical tool in selecting patients for facial reanimation surgery. Patients can be counseled for facial reanimation surgery as early as 6 months after surgery because satisfactory facial functional recovery is unlikely to occur when there is no clinical evidence of spontaneous nerve regeneration in the first 6 months.

Pub-med,Outcome of different facial nerve reconstruction techniques,"Introduction: There is no technique of facial nerve reconstruction that guarantees facial function recovery up to grade III. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different facial nerve reconstruction techniques. Methods: Facial nerve reconstruction was performed in 22 patients (facial nerve interpositional graft in 11 patients and hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer in another 11 patients). All patients had facial function House-Brackmann (HB) grade VI, either caused by trauma or after resection of a tumor. All patients were submitted to a primary nerve reconstruction except 7 patients, where late reconstruction was performed two weeks to four months after the initial surgery. The follow-up period was at least two years. Results: For facial nerve interpositional graft technique, we achieved facial function HB grade III in eight patients and grade IV in three patients. Synkinesis was found in eight patients, and facial contracture with synkinesis was found in two patients. In regards to hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer using different modifications, we achieved facial function HB grade III in nine patients and grade IV in two patients. Facial contracture, synkinesis and tongue atrophy were found in three patients, and synkinesis was found in five patients. However, those who had primary direct facial-hypoglossal end-to-side anastomosis showed the best result without any neurological deficit.

Pub-med,Assessment of T-shape double fascia graft for lower lip deformity from facial paralysis: A questionnaire survey,"Introduction: There are two main methods to treat lower-lip deformity (LLD) in facial paralysis. The first method is surgical intervention on the side of the paralysis, and the second involves denervating the depressor muscles on the healthy side. It is sometimes difficult for patients to ethically accept the denervating healthy tissue; therefore, we performed the T-shape double fascia graft (TSDFG), which reportedly restores symmetry. In this study, we report our experience with TSDFG and evaluation of the outcomes including the patient questionnaires. Methods: Two fascia strips from the thigh, 7 ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ 70 mm in size, were used; one was grafted horizontally at the lower lip to correct the static position, and the other was grafted obliquely at the lateral side by folding and crossing the horizontal fascia. A total of nine patients were treated by this procedure; three procedures were performed individually and six were performed in combination with another static or reanimation procedure. A questionnaire containing a five-point scoring system for facial appearance in multiple situations and other problems was sent to each patient at least 6 months after the surgery. Result: From the physicians' point of view, all patients achieved an improvement in symmetry of the lower lip, particularly when opening of the mouth; however, assessments from the patients demonstrated much less satisfaction. The main reason for the dissatisfaction was the slight bulkiness of the red lip. There was one comment that noted that with more treatment, the expectations were higher, and, as a result, the patient could not admit satisfaction at the end. Discussion: TSDFG is a simple and effective procedure for LLD; however, slight modifications may be required. In addition, there were some gaps in the perception of the results between the physicians and patients, and we need to consider these when planning to treat LLD.",0,,0,2,0,9,8,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2015.10.032,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2016 Mar;69(3):427-35. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2015.10.032.

Pub-med,"Treatment of complete facial palsy in adults: comparative study between direct hemihypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy, hemihipoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with grafts, and masseter to facial nerve transfer","Background: The hypoglossal (with or without grafts) and masseter nerves are frequently used as axon donors for facial reinnervation when no proximal stump of the facial nerve is available. We report our experience treating facial nerve palsies via hemihypoglossal-to-facial nerve transfers either with (HFG) or without grafts (HFD), comparing these outcomes against those of masseteric-to-facial nerve transfers (MF). Method: A total of 77 patients were analyzed retrospectively, including 51 HFD, 11 HFG, and 15 MF nerve transfer patients. Both the House-Brackmann (HB) scale and our own, newly-designed scale to rate facial reanimation post nerve transfer (quantifying symmetry at rest and when smiling, eye occlusion, and eye and mouth synkinesis when speaking) were used to enumerate the extent of recovery. Results: With both the HB and our own facial reanimation scale, the HFD and MF procedures yielded better outcome scores than HFG, though only the HGD was statistically superior. HGD produced slightly better scores than MF for everything but eye synkinesis, but these differences were generally not statistically significant. Delaying surgery beyond 2 years since injury was associated with appreciably worse outcomes when measured with our own but not the HB scale. The only predictors of outcome were the surgical technique employed and the duration of time between the initial injury and surgery. Conclusions: HFD appears to produce the most satisfactory facial reanimation results, with MF providing lesser but still satisfactory outcomes.

Pub-med,Facial Nerve Schwannomas: Review of 80 Cases Over 25 Years at Mayo Clinic,"Objective: To elucidate the long-term clinical behavior, treatment, and outcomes of sporadic facial nerve schwannoma (FNS) in a large cohort of patients managed in the post-magnetic resonance imaging era. Patients and methods: Retrospective review at a single tertiary health care system (January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2015), evaluating 80 consecutive patients with sporadic FNS. Results: Ninety-eight patients with FNS were identified; 10 with incomplete data and 8 with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The remaining 80 patients (median age, 47 years; 58% women) were analyzed. Forty-three (54%) patients presented with asymmetrical hearing loss, 33 (41%) reported facial paresis, and 21 (26%) reported facial spasm. Seventeen (21%) exhibited radiologic features mimicking vestibular schwannoma, 14 (18%) presented as a parotid mass, and 5 (6%) were discovered incidentally. Factors predictive of facial nerve paresis or spasm before treatment were female sex and tumor involvement of the labyrinthine/geniculate and tympanic facial nerve segments. The median growth rate among growing FNS was 2.0 mm/y. Details regarding clinical outcome according to treatment modality are described. Conclusion: In patients with FNS, female sex and involvement of the labyrinthine/geniculate and tympanic segments of the facial nerve predict a higher probability of facial paresis or spasm. When isolated to the posterior fossa or parotid gland, establishing a preoperative diagnosis of FNS is challenging.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation using hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with end-to-side coaptation between the jump interpositional nerve graft and hypoglossal nerve: Outcome and duration of preoperative paralysis,"Background: In this report, we described the use of hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with end-to-side coaptation between the jump interpositional nerve graft and the hypoglossal nerve for facial reanimation and analyzed the relationship between the outcome of surgery and duration of preoperative paralysis. Methods: We performed hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with the jump interpositional nerve graft on nine men and 10 women with unilateral complete facial paralysis. The patients, with a mean age of 39.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 18.1 years (range, 8-65 years) at the time of surgery, experienced preoperative paralysis ranging from 1 to 150 months (mean, 16.9 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 34.9 months).

Results: The mean follow-up was 5.6 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.6 years (range, 3-9 years). The movement of the corners of mouth was classified as excellent in two cases, good in seven cases, fair in two cases, and poor in eight cases. Nine of the 11 cases with preoperative paralysis of 6 months or less had excellent or good results, whereas none of the eight cases with preoperative paralysis of 7 months or longer yielded excellent or good results, showing a significant difference (P = 0.01). Conclusions: To achieve successful reanimation of the corners of the mouth, hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with end-to-side coaptation between the jump interpositional nerve graft and the hypoglossal nerve should be performed within 6 months after the onset of facial nerve paralysis. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Pub-med,Temporalis pull-through vs fascia lata augmentation in facial reanimation for facial paralysis,"Objectives: Surgical rehabilitation of facial palsy is challenging as each case is unique and success rate is often unpredictable. In one technique, temporalis is elevated from origin preserving vessels, and this elevation increases the length which is tunneled into buccal tissues (pull-through technique, Group A). In the other technique, a harvested fascia lata is attached to temporalis after a coronoidectomy release and the fascia lata is attached to the modiolus (Group B). The aim of this study is to compare the two different surgical techniques. Materials and methods: Case records of 22 cases, 15 females, and 7 males who were operated between 2008 and 2012 for facial palsy with at least 1-year follow-up, using either of the techniques were assessed for pull of muscle, postoperative pain, recovery time, motor control, and symmetry at rest. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results: The Group A (n = 7) and Group B (n = 15) formed the study group. In the Group A, residual asymmetry (n = 3), poor postoperative muscle pull (n = 2) were noticed while in the modified group it was 2 and 3, respectively. The technique used in Group B had better pull of muscle, symmetry, faster recovery time, and better motor control at 1-year follow-up than the conventional technique. Discussion and conclusion: The difference between the two groups is due to preservation of original muscular architecture, vascular channel supply. As the muscle is not traumatized, no fibrosis occurs aiding regaining of normal function. In addition, the facial reanimation is more successful in the Group B. The mechanism and success behind the technique used in Group B is discussed elaborately in terms of localregional anatomy and physiology.",0,,0,0,,0,2,3,0,10.4103/2231-0746.200323,Ann Maxillofac Surg. 2016 Jul-Dec;6(2):267-271. doi: 10.4103/2231-0746.200323.,Balaji SM.,2016,28299269,Visual analog scale (VAS),22,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,

Pub-med,Facial nerve repair after operative injury: Impact of timing on hypoglossal-facial nerve graft outcomes,"Purpose: Reanimation of facial paralysis is a complex problem with multiple treatment options. One option is hypoglossal-facial nerve grafting, which can be performed in the immediate postoperative period after nerve transection, or in a delayed setting after skull base surgery when the nerve is anatomically intact but function is poor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of timing of hypoglossal-facial grafting on functional outcome. Materials and methods: A retrospective case series from a single tertiary otologic referral center was performed identifying 60 patients with facial nerve injury following cerebellopontine angle tumor extirpation. Patients underwent hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis following facial nerve injury. Facial nerve function was measured using the House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system at a median follow-up interval of 18months.

Pub-med,Transposition of the Intratemporal Facial to Hypoglossal Nerve for Reanimation of the Paralyzed Face: The VII to XII TranspositionTechnique,"Importance: The hypoglossal nerve has long been an axonal source for reinnervation of the paralyzed face. In this study, we report our experience with transposition of the intratemporal facial nerve to the hypoglossal nerve for facial reanimation. Objectives: To determine the feasibility and outcomes of the transposition of the infratemeporal facial nerve for end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve for facial reanimation. Design, settings, and participants: A case series of 20 patients with facial paralysis who underwent mobilization and transposition of the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve for an end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve (the VII to XII technique). Participants were treated between January 2007 and December 2014 at a tertiary care center. Main outcomes and measures: Outcome measures include paralysis duration, facial tone, facial symmetry at rest, and with smile, oral commissure excursion, post-reanimation volitional smile, and synkinesis. Methods: Demographic data, the effects of this technique on facial tone, symmetry, oral commissure excursion and smile recovery were evaluated. Preoperative and postoperative photography and videography were reviewed. Facial symmetry was assessed with a facial asymmetry index. Smile outcomes were evaluated with a visual smile recovery scale, and lip excursion was assessed with the MEEI-SMILE system. Results: All 20 patients had adequate length of facial nerve mobilized for direct end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve. The median duration of facial paralysis prior to treatment was 11.4 months. Median follow-up time was 29 months. Three patients were excluded from functional analysis due to lack of follow-up. Facial symmetry at rest and during animation improved in 16 of 17 patients. The median (range) time for return of facial muscle tone was 7.3 (2.0-12.0) months. A significant reduction in facial asymmetry index occurred at rest and with movement. The MEEI FACE-gram software detected a significant increase in horizontal, vertical, overall lip excursion and smile angle. No patient developed significant tongue atrophy, impaired tongue mobility, or speech or swallow dysfunction. Conclusions and relevence: Mobilization of the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve provides adequate length for direct end-to-end coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve and is effective in restoring facial tone and symmetry after facial paralysis. The resulting smile is symmetric or nearly symmetric in the majority of patients with varying degree of dental show. The additional length provided by utilizing the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve reduces the deficits associated with complete hypoglossal division/splitting, and avoids the need for interposition grafts and multiple coaptation sites.

Pub-med,Lengthening Temporalis Myoplasty for Single-Stage Smile Reconstruction in Children with Facial Paralysis,"Background: Free muscle transfer for dynamic smile reanimation in facial paralysis is not always predictable with regard to cosmesis. Hospital stays range from 5 to 7 days. Prolonged operative times, longer hospital stays, and excessive cheek bulk are associated with free flap options. Lengthening temporalis myoplasty offers single-stage smile reanimation with theoretical advantages over free tissue transfer. Methods: From 2012 to 2014, 18 lengthening temporalis myoplasties were performed in 14 children for smile reconstruction. A retrospective chart review was completed for demographics, operative times, length of hospital stay, and perioperative complications. Results: Fourteen consecutive patients with complete facial paralysis were included. Four patients underwent single-stage bilateral reconstruction, and 10 underwent unilateral procedures. Diagnoses included M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome (n = 5), posterior cranial fossa tumors (n = 4), posttraumatic (n = 2), hemifacial microsomia (n = 1), and idiopathic (n = 2). Average patient age was 10.1 years. Average operative time was 410 minutes (499 minutes for bilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty and 373 for unilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty). Average length of stay was 3.3 days (4.75 days for bilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty and 2.8 for unilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty). Nine patients required minor revisions. Conclusions: Lengthening temporalis myoplasty is a safe alternative to free tissue transfer for dynamic smile reconstruction in children with facial paralysis. Limited donor-site morbidity, shorter operative times, and shorter hospital stays are some benefits over free flap options. However, revisions are required frequently secondary to tendon avulsions and adhesions.

Pub-med,Use of the submental vessels for free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation,"Background: Free muscle transfer is an important in dynamic facial reanimation; however, suitable donor vessels in this population can be inadequate. In this case series, the submental vessels were used as donors to free gracilis muscle in vessel-depleted patients. Methods: Five patients underwent free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation, 2 with a prior failed free gracilis transfer, 2 with vascular anomalies, and 1 with previous distal ligation of the facial vessels. The submental artery was used as a donor in all cases, and the submental vein was used in 3 cases. Results: There were no complications or flap failure. Postoperative arterial and venous blood flow was confirmed in all patients using Doppler color flow imaging above and below the anastomoses. Conclusion: The submental vessels are suitable for microvascular anastomosis for free flaps having short pedicles, such as the free gracilis muscle flap, in the vessel-depleted hemiface. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Pub-med,Assessment of functional outcomes of temporalis muscle transfers for patients with longstanding facial paralysis,"Background: Usually, clinical evaluation of facial reanimation provides accurate information about contraction of the mimetic muscles and phonation but fails to identify smile recovery and to quantify the motility of the lower third of the face during a smile. The purpose of this study was to verify that, in longstanding facial palsy, the modified temporalis muscle transfer (MTMT) can result in the ability to smile, not only voluntarily with chewing, but also spontaneously with a sudden emotional stimulus, and to confirm that a symmetric smile can be obtained. Methods: Ten patients of the treated group (group T; 4 women and 6 men) were randomly selected from a population of 24 patients with longstanding facial palsy treated by MTMT. Five normal subjects of the control group (group C; 3 women and 2 men) were enrolled as the control population. Functional outcomes after transposed temporalis muscle were examined and measured through clinical assessment by using a scored smile symmetry grading system, video recording, and surface electromyography (sEMG). In addition, the voluntary smile test (VST) and the not-voluntary smile test (NVST) were performed to study voluntary and spontaneous smiling. Results: Subjects in the VST group (group T) were able to smile voluntarily and the expression was characterized by symmetry. In the NVST group, they were able to smile spontaneously and the symmetry of the smile was maintained for 8 subjects and only partially for 2 subjects. During both tests, the temporalis muscle of the treated side and the orbicularis oris muscle of the not-treated side were activated during smiling, indicating spontaneous activity of the transposed temporalis muscle with an emotional stimulus. For the control group, smiles during VST and NVST were symmetric and the temporalis muscles were not activated during smiling, whereas the orbicularis oris muscles were. Conclusion: Our study shows that the Morrison MTMT is able to restore the voluntary smile ability. Particularly, this technique allows for recovery of the spontaneous smile with symmetry. This assessment would seem to suggest that the transposed temporalis muscle might adapt from a chewing to a mimetic muscle. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Pub-med,Intracranial Facial Nerve Grafting in the Setting of Skull Base Tumors: Global and Regional Facial Function Analysis and Possible Implications for Facial Reanimation Surgery,"Background: Reconstructive surgeons may encounter patients presenting after intracranial facial nerve resection and grafting in the setting of skull base tumors, who inquire regarding progression, final facial function, and need for future operations. Study goals were to analyze global and regional facial function using established grading systems and videography, while examine variables possibly affecting outcomes. Methods: Between 1997 and 2012, 28 patients underwent intracranial nerve grafting. Fifteen were prospectively evaluated by three facial nerve physical therapists with the Facial Nerve Grading System 2.0 and the Sunnybrook Facial Grading Score for function and the Facial Disability Index for quality of life. Still photographs and videography were used to assess quality of motion and tone, while demographic and medical variables were analyzed regarding their effect on end results. Results: Average patient age was 41.9 years (range, 22 to 66 years), and there were 10 women and five men. Average time interval between nerve grafting and evaluations was 42.9 months (range, 12 to 146 months). Both grading scores demonstrated best outcomes in the periorbita and worst outcomes in the brow. Buccinator muscle tone also improved. The average total Facial Disability Index was 67.5 percent. Although not statistically significant, the data suggest that nerve gap length affected total resting symmetry and voluntary movement, whereas preoperative palsy and age may affect total resting symmetry. Perioperative radiation therapy, tumor type, donor nerve, and coaptation technique were not found to affect outcomes. Conclusions: Intracranial facial nerve grafting largely provides better resting tone and facial symmetry, potentially improving end results of future intervention; however, overall voluntary facial motion is poor.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation by muscle-nerve neurotization after facial nerve sacrifice. Case report,"Introduction: Recovering a certain degree of mimicry after sacrifice of the facial nerve is a clinically recognized finding. The authors report a case of hemifacial reanimation suggesting a phenomenon of neurotization from muscle-to-nerve. Clinical case: A woman benefited from a parotidectomy with sacrifice of the left facial nerve indicated for recurrent tumor in the gland. The distal branches of the facial nerve, isolated at the time of resection, were buried in the masseter muscle underneath. The patient recovered a voluntary h‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬©mifacial motricity. The electromyographic analysis of the motor activity of the zygomaticus major before and after block of the masseter nerve showed a dependence between mimic muscles and the masseter muscle. Discussion: Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the spontaneous reanimation of facial paralysis. The clinical case makes it possible to argue in favor of muscle-to-nerve neurotization from masseter muscle to distal branches of the facial nerve. It illustrates the quality of motricity that can be obtained thanks to this procedure. Conclusion: The authors describe a simple implantation technique of distal branches of the facial nerve in the masseter muscle during a radical parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice and recovery of resting tone but also a quality voluntary mimicry.",2,,0,1,0,9,6,2,0,10.1016/j.anplas.2015.07.010,Ann Chir Plast Esthet. 2016 Dec;61(6):886-891. doi: 10.1016/j.anplas.2015.07.010.

Pub-med,Evolution of Patients With Immediate Complete Facial Paralysis Secondary to Acoustic Neuroma Surgery,"Objective: To study the evolution of patients with immediate complete facial paralysis after acoustic neuroma surgery in different scenarios and assess different facial reanimations techniques. Methods: This study included 50 patients with complete facial paralysis immediately after acoustic neuroma surgery. Data were analyzed into 4 groups according to the need and type of reconstruction of the facial nerve, either none, immediate, or on a deferred basis. All patients had intraoperative facial nerve monitoring, and facial nerve function was evaluated according the House-Brackmann (HB) scale. Results: Of all patients with immediate total paralysis, no patients achieved totally normal facial function (grade I), and only 5 (10%) recovered to a grade II. For all groups included, the majority of patients (82%) achieved an acceptable final facial function (grade III HB). In this series, only 2 patients remained with a grade VI facial function. Conclusions: The possibility of recovering near normal facial function after a grade VI facial paralysis is very low. Procedures like the immediate repair of the facial nerve with an interposed donor graft may provide better facial function in patients with partially injured facial nerve. Even in cases of total section, there are other procedures that can improve the results.",0,,0,2,9,9,2,1,0,10.1177/0003489415624700,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol. 2016 Jun;125(6):495-500. doi: 10.1177/0003489415624700.

Pub-med,Single innervated segmented vastus lateralis for miDFacial reanimation during radical parotidectomy,"Background: Innervated free muscle transfer using the gracilis muscle or temporalis myoplasty has been successfully utilized for facial reanimation in chronic facial palsy. These techniques are less suited to immediate facial reconstruction in the setting of radical parotidectomy, in which the complexity of the defect, patient age, postoperative radiotherapy, and limited life expectancy pose particular challenges. Methods: We present a novel description of the use of a chimeric anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap and innervated vastus lateralis to achieve miDFace static suspension and dynamic reanimation in the setting of radical parotidectomy. Results: The technique is described in detail along with a video demonstrating the early and medium-term results in an example case. Conclusion: Although outcomes using the vastus lateralis free flap for miDFace reanimation need to be objectively determined, the flap adds the potential of dynamic miDFace movement in patients undergoing radical parotidectomy who would otherwise not be afforded this opportunity. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Pub-med,Test-Retest Reliability and Agreement Between In-Person and Video Assessment of Facial Mimetic Function Using the eFACE Facial Grading System,"Importance: Use of a robust high-resolution instrument for grading of facial symmetry would enhance reporting the outcomes of facial reanimation interventions. The eFACE is one such tool. Objective: To determine test-retest reliability of the eFACE tool over time and agreement between eFACE assessments made in person vs those made using video of facial mimetic function. Design, setting, and participants: A prospective observational study was conducted among 75 consecutive patients with varying degrees of facial palsy who presented between July 1 and December 31, 2014, to an academic tertiary referral hospital. Facial symmetry of all patients was graded in person and via standardized photographic and video documentation of facial mimetic function at the initial visit. Three months after initial presentation, eFACE scores were reassessed by the same raters using the videos of facial mimetic function documented at the initial visit. Main outcomes and measures: Individual and subset eFACE scores assessed by 2 facial reanimation surgeons. Results: Among the 75 patients in the study (mean [SD] age, 48.18 [16.60] years; 30 men and 45 women), agreement between in-person and video assessments of facial function using the eFACE scale was excellent (static subset score: mean difference, 0.19; 95% CI, -1.51 to 1.88; P = .83; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.89; dynamic subset score: mean difference, -0.51; 95% CI, -1.72 to 0.71; P = .41; ICC, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.97; synkinesis subset score: mean difference, -1.14; 95% CI, -2.87 to 0.59; P = .20; ICC, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93; and composite score: mean difference, -0.41; 95% CI, -1.30 to 0.47; P = .36; ICC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). Agreement between repeated eFACE assessments of video of facial function was excellent (static subset score: ICC, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.96; dynamic subset score: ICC, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.94; synkinesis subset score: ICC, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96; and composite score: ICC, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93 to 0.98).

Pub-med,Free anterolateral thigh flap and masseter nerve transfer for reconstruction of extensive periauricular defects: Surgical technique and clinical outcomes,"Background: Radical tumor ablation in the periauricular area often results in extensive soft tissue defects, including facial nerve sacrifice, bone and/or dura defects. Reconstruction of these defects should aim at restoring facial reanimation, wound closure, and facial and neck contours. We present our experience using free anterolateral thigh flap (ALT) in combination with masseter nerve to facial nerve transfer in managing complex defects in the periauricular area. Methods: Between 2011 and 2015 six patients underwent a combined procedure of ALT flap reconstruction and masseter nerve transfer, to reconstruct extensive, post tumor resection, periauricular defects. The ALT flap was customized according to the defect. For smile restoration, the masseter nerve was transferred to the buccal branch of the facial nerve. If the facial nerve stump was preserved, interposition of nerve grafts to the zygomatic and frontal branches was performed to provide separate eye closure. The outcomes were analyzed by assessing wound closure, contour deformity, symmetry of the face, and facial nerve function. Results: There were no partial or total flap losses. Stable wound closure and adequate volume replacement in the neck was achieved in all cases, as well as good facial tonus and symmetry. The mean follow-up time of clinical outcomes was 16.8 months. Smile restoration was graded as good or excellent in four cases, moderate in one and fair in one. Conclusion: Extensive periauricular defects following oncologic resection could be adequately reconstructed in a combined procedure of free ALT flap and masseter nerve transfer to the facial nerve for smile restoration.",2,,2,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1002/micr.30086,Microsurgery. 2017 Sep;37(6):479-486. doi: 10.1002/micr.30086.

Pub-med,Masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy: results of a case series,"OBJECTIVE Facial palsy is a well-known functional and esthetic problem that bothers most patients and affects their social relationships. When the time between the onset of paralysis and patient presentation is less than 18 months and the proximal stump of the injured facial nerve is not available, another nerve must be anastomosed to the facial nerve to reactivate its function. The masseteric nerve has recently gained popularity over the classic hypoglossus nerve as a new motor source because of its lower associated morbidity rate and the relative ease with which the patient can activate it. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy for early facial reanimation. METHODS Thirty-four consecutive patients (21 females, 13 males) with early unilateral facial paralysis underwent masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy in which an interpositional nerve graft of the great auricular or sural nerve was placed. The time between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 2 to 18 months (mean 13.3 months). Electromyography revealed mimetic muscle fibrillations in all the patients. Before surgery, all patients had House-Brackmann Grade VI facial nerve dysfunction. Twelve months after the onset of postoperative facial nerve reactivation, each patient underwent a clinical examination using the modified House-Brackmann grading scale as a guide. RESULTS Overall, 91.2% of the patients experienced facial nerve function reactivation. Facial recovery began within 2-12 months (mean 6.3 months) with the restoration of facial symmetry at rest. According to the modified House-Brackmann grading scale, 5.9% of the patients had Grade I function, 61.8% Grade II, 20.6% Grade III, 2.9% Grade V, and 8.8% Grade VI. The morbidity rate was low; none of the patients could feel the loss of masseteric nerve function. There were only a few complications, including 1 case of postoperative bleeding (2.9%) and 2 local infections (5.9%), and a few patients complained about partial loss of sensitivity of the earlobe or a small area of the ankle and foot, depending on whether great auricular or sural nerves were harvested. CONCLUSIONS The surgical technique described here seems to be efficient for the early treatment of facial paralysis and results in very little morbidity.",2,,0,0,9,7,2,1,0,10.3171/2015.12.JNS14601,J Neurosurg. 2017 Jan;126(1):312-318. doi: 10.3171/2015.12.JNS14601.

Pub-med,Symmetry Restoration at Rest after Masseter-to-Facial Nerve Transfer: Is It as Efficient as Smile Reanimation?,"Background: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a highly efficient technique for reanimating paralyzed muscle and has been reported to restore facial symmetry at rest. However, no systematic studies have been performed, and the effects of preoperative droop of the oral commissure on postoperative symmetry at rest have rarely been reported. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed 35 patients with masseteric-to-facial nerve anastomosis and assessed the quality and quantity of the dynamic recovery and the oral commissure symmetry at rest. The dynamic and static effects were then compared. Results: All of the patients' Terzis scores were increased postoperatively, and over half of the patients presented restored symmetric smiles (Terzis scores of 4 or 5). The postoperative symmetry scale of the oral commissure at rest improved in 18 of 35 patients. Both the mean postoperative altitude difference of oral commissure excursion and the postoperative altitude difference of bilateral oral commissure position were decreased compared with preoperative values. The preoperative symmetry had a significant effect on the postoperative altitude difference of the bilateral oral commissure position. The effects of the dynamic and static symmetry improvements were transformed to a comparable factor ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢‚àö‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√¢‚Ä†¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±. The dynamic ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢‚àö‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√¢‚Ä†¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± was significantly greater than the static ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢‚àö‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√¢‚Ä†¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±. Conclusions: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a reliable technique for smile reanimation. However, it has only a limited effect on the improvement of symmetry at rest. Assessing the preoperative symmetry of the oral commissure at rest can be used to predict postoperative outcomes, and patients with severe droop of the oral commissure (symmetry scale grade III or IV) should receive static suspension.",2,,0,3,0,9,8,3,0,10.1097/PRS.0000000000003698,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2017 Oct;140(4):793-801. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000003698.,"Chen G, Wang W, Wang W, Ding W, Yang X.",2017,28617736,"Tools: Terzis', FACEgram Outcomes:symmetry, oral commissure excursion, ",35,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:masseteric-to-facial,anastomosis",,Masseteric nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Outcome of a graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation in patients with facial paralysis,"Peripheral paralysis of the facial nerve is the most frequent of all cranial nerve disorders. Despite advances in facial surgery, the functional and aesthetic reconstruction of a paralyzed face remains a challenge. Graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation is based on a modular principle. According to the patients' needs, precondition, and expectations, the following modules can be performed: temporalis muscle transposition and facelift, nasal valve suspension, endoscopic brow lift, and eyelid reconstruction. Applying a concept of a graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation may help minimize surgical trauma and reduce morbidity. Twenty patients underwent a graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation. A retrospective chart review was performed with a follow-up examination between 1 and 8 months after surgery. The FACEgram software was used to calculate pre- and postoperative eyelid closure, the level of brows, nasal, and philtral symmetry as well as oral commissure position at rest and oral commissure excursion with smile. As a patient-oriented outcome parameter, the Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire was applied. There was a statistically significant improvement in the postoperative score of eyelid closure, brow asymmetry, nasal asymmetry, philtral asymmetry as well as oral commissure symmetry at rest (p < 0.05). Smile evaluation revealed no significant change of oral commissure excursion. The mean Glasgow Benefit Inventory score indicated substantial improvement in patients' overall quality of life. If a primary facial nerve repair or microneurovascular tissue transfer cannot be applied, graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation is a promising option to restore facial function and symmetry at rest.",0,,0,1,0,9,8,1,0,10.1007/s00405-017-4551-6,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2017 Aug;274(8):3241-3249. doi: 10.1007/s00405-017-4551-6.

Pub-med,Smile Reanimation after Unilateral Facial Palsy by Lengthening Temporalis Myoplasty: Objective and Subjective Evaluation on 25 Cases,"Background: Comparison of functional results of lengthening temporalis myoplasty relies in current practice on subjective scales. The goal of this study was to define a simple, reproducible, objective scale validated through a comparison with a subjective scale for smile symmetrization results after temporal muscle myoplasty. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 25 patients having a unilateral facial palsy and rehabilitated with lengthening temporalis myoplasty. Evaluation consisted of objective measures: smile horizontal symmetry between left and right sides, vertical symmetry, and smile width on healthy and paretic sides on preoperative and postoperative photographs. Subjective scales were also used (i.e., a numeric scale and the Terzis and Noah scale) by a jury (four professionals and four nonprofessionals) and the patient himself or herself. Each evaluation was performed in three conditions: at rest, at intermediary smile, and at maximum smile. Results: Comparison of objective measures on the impaired side showed a postoperative improvement in the three conditions evaluation. Reproducibility of the numeric scale was weak for evaluation at rest and fair for maximum smile evaluation (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.57). The Terzis and Noah scale was not reproducible from one observer to another. At maximum smile, a correlation between smile symmetry in the vertical plane, smile symmetry in the horizontal plane, and professional evaluation with the numeric scale on the one hand and global patient satisfaction on the other hand was observed. Conclusion: Postoperative smile horizontal symmetry between left and right sides, and smile vertical symmetry, are good indicators with which to assess postoperative results of facial palsy rehabilitation.",0,,0,1,0,9,8,1,0,10.1097/PRS.0000000000003217,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2017 Apr;139(4):984e-993e. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000003217.,"Foirest C, Granger B, Gatignol P, Bernat I, Nguyen Y, Lamas G, Tankere F.",2017,28002243,,25,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,A technique for facial reanimation: The partial temporalis muscle-tendon transfer with a fascia lata sling,"Background: This report describes the results of a surgical procedure for facial reanimation. This single-stage technique involves the orthodromic transfer of only a superficial segment of the temporalis tendon. This is extended with fascia lata to achieve elevation of the oral commissure along the desired vector in the paralysed hemi-face. Methods: A retrospective case note review was performed. Patients' photographs were objectively evaluated with Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation (FACE) software. Results: Thirty-nine patients underwent the procedure from 2001 to 2011. Median age at the operation was 57.0 years (interquartile range (IQR) 38.2-66.3 years), and median duration of follow-up was 0.9 years (IQR 0.5-1.8 years). All patients achieved early improvements in appearance and function after surgery. Three patients underwent further, minor procedures for aesthetic and functional adjustments around the oral commissure. Complications occurred in three patients: two minor facial haematomas and one thigh wound infection. The surgery did not disturb natural temporalis muscle function. FACE analysis demonstrated that no significant movement of the oral commissure occurred during attempted smiling in the paralysed hemi-face before surgery. However, symmetry was achieved when the healthy and paralysed hemi-faces were compared post-operatively, both in repose and during controlled smiling. Conclusions: This modified, single-stage technique for facial reanimation improves commissure mobilisation and has been objectively shown to restore symmetry of the commissure to the reanimated hemi-face.",0,,0,1,9,1,1,2,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2016.10.011,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2017 Mar;70(3):313-321. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2016.10.011.

Pub-med,Analysis of the ideal muscle weight of gracilis muscle transplants for facial reanimation surgery with regard to the donor nerve and outcome,"Background: Free functional muscle transfers represent the 'criterion standard' for smile reconstruction in facial paralysis. The gracilis muscle is a common donor muscle; however, no data exist regarding the volume of the muscle tissue that is necessary for symmetric commissure excursion. Methods: All patients with facial paralysis receiving a free functional muscle transfer for facial reanimation surgery between January 2009 and November 2015 were retrospectively analysed. Only patients with unilateral facial paralysis and documented weight of the muscle portion were included. The extent of oral commissure amplitude was determined from standardised photographs. Results: In total, 42 free functional gracilis transfers were performed during the study period, of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Eight muscles were innervated by a cross-facial nerve graft (CFNG) and 14 by the masseteric nerve. Segments between 19 and 50 g of weight (mean: CFNG, 33.9 g and masseteric nerve, 31.7 g; p = 0.59) were transferred. Coaptation to the masseteric nerve led to increased commissure excursion compared to coaptation to the CFNG. We observed a significant increase in commissure excursion with increasing muscle weight in the masseteric nerve group. In this group, four patients underwent secondary flap debulking in flaps weighing ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´¬¨¬®¬¨¬¢27 g. In the CFNG group, only one patient, who had an initial flap weight of 50 g, underwent secondary flap reduction. Thinning reduced the oral commissure movement but improved the symmetry of commissure excursion and the aesthetic result. Conclusion: The ideal muscle weight depends on the donor nerve and should be smaller for masseteric nerve than for CFNG coaptation in adults.",4,,1,3,10,3,4,1,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2016.12.005,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2017 Apr;70(4):459-468. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2016.12.005.

Pub-med,Masseteric nerve for gracilis muscle re-innervation in unilateral facial palsy: Impact on quality of life,"Background: Unilateral established or congenital facial palsies are usually treated with neuromuscular transplantation to reanimate the impaired side of the face. One of the most debated points is the motor nerve to choose for the reinnervation of the transplant. Contra-lateral healthy facial nerve is usually preferred, but in selected cases motor nerve to masseter is considered a valuable option. However only a few clinical studies focused on quality of life in this subset of patients are available in literature. Methods: Twenty patients treated for established or congenital unilateral facial palsy reanimated with gracilis muscle transplant reinnervated with masseteric nerve were retrospectively analyzed. The FDI questionnaire on quality of life was administered before and after surgery and statistical analysis of results was conducted to score changes. Results: Overall results of the questionnaire resulted in a statistically significant improvement after surgery, with a p value of 0.05. Conclusion: Facial animation with gracilis muscle transplant re-innervated with masseteric nerve is a safe and reliable procedure in selected unilateral facial palsy patients. Results reported here confirm that surgery mainly improves the functional aspects of a patient's daily life quality, while the impact on social interactions and self-perception is less significant. The comparison of these results with those obtained in patients treated with gracilis muscle transplant re-innervated via contralateral facial nerve suggests that spontaneity is probably highly relevant to improve social aspects of QOL in this subset of patients.",2,,1,0,0,4,3,1,0,10.1016/j.jcms.2017.03.021,J Craniomaxillofac Surg. 2017 Jul;45(7):1051-1057. doi: 10.1016/j.jcms.2017.03.021.

Pub-med,Single stage aesthetic and functional reconstruction of composite facial gunshot wound with a chimeric functioning muscle and fibular osseous flap. Case report and review of the literature,"The current concepts in the aesthetic and functional reconstruction of complex oromandibular defects are presented with a case of a patient with self-inflicted gunshot wound to the face. The patient presented with a 6 cm composite mandibular defect; the buccomandibular and suborbital aesthetic zones of the cheek along with the mucosa lining, and the ipsilateral facial musculature were missing. A rapid prototyping model of the facial skeleton was used to assist in preoperative planning. A single stage reconstruction with two free flaps was planned; a free fibula osseous flap to reconstruct the mandibular defect, and a free chimeric ALT/functioning vastus lateralis muscle. The one skin paddle of the chimeric flap reconstructed the buccomandibular/suborbital zones of the cheek, and the other the lining of the mouth. The functional muscle provided reanimation of the corner of the mouth by coapting the muscle's motor nerve to the ipsilateral marginal mandibular nerve. A good facial contour and reanimation of the mouth with oral continence was achieved, and the patient presented with good social and emotional smile. This first report of combined use of a fibula osseous flap with a chimeric functional ALT/Vastus Lateralis flap suggests that the chimeric flap principle may be used in complex aesthetic and functional challenges of severe facial trauma.",5,,2,0,0,2,4,1,0,10.1002/micr.30140,Microsurgery. 2017 Sep;37(6):674-679. doi: 10.1002/micr.30140.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation using hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after schwannoma removal,"Conclusion: In this series, the split type hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis resulted in more favorable outcomes in terms of both facial function and tongue atrophy. Objective: This study compared surgical techniques for hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after schwannoma removal and evaluated which technique achieves better facial outcomes and less tongue morbidity. Method: This study included 14 patients who underwent hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after schwannoma removal and were followed for more than 1 year. Three surgical techniques were performed: end-to-end, end-to-side, and split anastomoses. Facial palsy and tongue atrophy after anastomosis were evaluated using the scales suggested by House-Brackmann and Martins, respectively. Tumor volume and the time to surgery were also evaluated, and the effects on facial outcomes were analyzed. Results: Overall, nine of 14 (64.3%) patients had favorable facial outcomes, and eight of 14 (57.1%) had favorable tongue outcomes. Regarding facial palsy, five of seven (71.4%) end-to-end, three of four (75%) split, and only one of three (33.3%) end-to-side patients had favorable facial function. Regarding tongue atrophy, all three (100%) end-to-side, three of four (75%) split, and two of seven (28.6%) end-to-end patients had favorable tongue outcomes.

Embase,Hemihypoglossal‚Äö√†√≠Facial Nerve Anastomosis for Facial Nerve Reanimation: Case Series and Technical Note,"Background: Hypoglossal nerve injury may result in swallowing and speech problems. To reduce this morbidity and allow the performance of the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis bilaterally, a technique that includes partial splitting of the hypoglossal nerve and skeletonization of the facial nerve within the mastoid process has been applied. The aim of this study is to present clinical results regarding the facial and hypoglossal nerves after the procedure. Methods: Prospectively collected data from 56 consecutive patients who underwent hemihypoglossal‚Äö√†√≠facial nerve anastomosis (HHFA) were analyzed. The outcome was correlated with epidemiologic data, initial disease, the presence of neurofibromatosis type 2, previous radiosurgery, and the time between nerve injury and reconstructive surgery. Results: Forty-eight (84%) patients achieved satisfactory outcomes; 8 of them (14%) showed some improvement, and in 1 patient (2%) there was no improvement during long-term observation. The result at follow-up was not related to the time interval between the 2 procedures. However, recovery times for facial tonicity were statistically significantly longer if the procedure was performed after 12 months (P = 0.044). There was no statistically significant association between patient age (P = 0.96) or sex (P = 0.13) and facial nerve function. HHFA resulted in no or minimal tongue atrophy without deviation in 53 patients (93%), and the remainder had mild hemiatrophy with tongue deviation <30 degrees. Conclusions: HHFA is an effective technique for facial nerve reanimation with acceptable morbidity related to tongue function. Patients with a longer duration of facial palsy still have a good chance for restoration of facial movement but require longer recovery periods.",3,,0,0,10,4,2,1,0,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.06.217,World Neurosurgery (2018) 118 (e460-e467).

Pub-med,Comparison of Objective Outcomes in Dynamic Lower Facial Reanimation With Temporalis Tendon and Gracilis Free Muscle Transfer,"Importance: Facial paralysis affects patients' physical, social, and psychological function. Dynamic smile reanimation can mitigate these effects, but there are limited data to guide the surgeon in selecting the best reanimation procedure for each patient. Objective: To compare quantitative changes in oral commissure symmetry and smile excursion following temporalis tendon transfer (T3) and gracilis free muscle transfer. Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective case series of 28 adults with unilateral facial paralysis seeking dynamic lower facial reanimation at a tertiary academic medical center between July 1, 2010, and July 30, 2014. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016. Interventions: Minimally invasive T3 (n = 14) compared with gracilis free muscle transfer (n = 14). Main outcomes and measures: Measured symmetry of the oral commissure between the healthy and paralyzed sides in the horizontal, vertical, and angular dimension and excursion of the paralyzed commissure following reanimation compared with the healthy commissure. Results: Of the 28 patients, 19 (68%) were women; mean (SD) age was 51.7 (17) years. Commissure symmetry during smile improved significantly for the T3 patients in the vertical and angular dimensions, and the gracilis free muscle transfer patients had significant improvement in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Commissure excursion significantly improved in both groups following surgery, with a larger improvement seen in the gracilis free muscle transfer group (11.3 mm; 95% CI, 7.0 to 15.5 mm) compared with the T3 group (4.8 mm; 95% CI, 0.2 to 9.3 mm), with a mean difference of 6.5 mm (95% CI, 0.7 to 12.4 mm; Cohen d, 0.86). Postoperative smile excursion of the paralyzed side was within 1.0 mm of the healthy side in the gracilis free muscle transfer group (95% CI, -2.1 to 4.0 mm). Conclusions and relevance: Temporalis tendon transfer and gracilis free muscle transfer both improve oral commissure symmetry and excursion in facial paralysis. The improvement in smile excursion appears to be larger in patients treated with gracilis free muscle transfer and, on average, the excursion approximates the contralateral healthy side.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,3,3,9,1,2,0,10.1001/jamaoto.2018.1964,JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2018 Dec 1;144(12):1162-1168. doi: 10.1001/jamaoto.2018.1964.,"Oyer SL, Nellis J, Ishii LE, Boahene KD, Byrne PJ.",2018,30325983,"Tools: photos, FACEgram, Outcomes: Facial commissure symmetry, smile excursion",28,,,,,Double innervation,,,,,,
Pub-med,The Multivector Gracilis Free Functional Muscle Flap for Facial Reanimation,"Importance: A multivector functional muscle flap that closely simulates the biomechanical effects of facial muscle groups is essential for complete smile restoration after facial paralysis. Objective: To determine the feasibility of a multivector gracilis muscle flap design for reanimation after facial paralysis and to analyze the effect on the smile display zone. Design, setting, and participants: Prospective analysis of patients who underwent a double paddle multivector gracilis flap for complete facial paralysis between June 2015 and December 2016 was carried out in a tertiary hospital. Interventions: The gracilis muscle was harvested as a double paddle flap and inserted along 2 vectors for facial reanimation. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome measures were: (1) dental display (the number of maxillary teeth displayed on paralyzed vs normal sides), (2) exposed maxillary gingival scaffold width, (3) interlabial gap at midline and canine, (4) facial asymmetry index (FAI), and (5) dynamic periorbital wrinkling. Results: There were 10 women and 2 men between ages 20 and 64 years (mean [SD], 46 [15] years). Five flaps were reinnervated with facial and masseteric nerves, 5 with masseteric nerve only, and 2 with crossfacial nerve only. There was functional muscle recovery in all cases. On average there was additional 3.1 maxillary teeth exposed posttreatment when smiling (5.5 vs 8.6; CI, 7.9 to 16.6; P < .001). The mean exposed maxillary gingival scaffold width improved from 31.5 mm to 43.7 mm (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.3; P < .001). There was no significant difference in interlabial exposure at midline (7.1 mm vs 7.7 mm; CI, -1.5 to 2.7; P = .56) but a 56.4% improvement at the level of the canines (3.9 vs 6.1; CI, 0.1 to 4.3; P = .04). The mean FAI when smiling was reduced from 9.1 mm to 4.5 mm (CI, -8.0 to -1.2; P = .01). Dynamic wrinkling of the periorbital area with smiling was noted in 4 patients. Conclusions and relevance: The gracilis flap can be reliably designed as a functional double paddle muscle flap for a multivector facial reanimation. The multivector gracilis flap design is effective in improving all components of the smile display zone and has the potential for producing periorbital-wrinkling characteristic of a Duchenne smile.

Pub-med,"Comparison of Functional Results After Cross-Face Nerve Graft-, Spinal Accessory Nerve-, and Masseter Nerve-Innervated Gracilis for Facial Paralysis Reconstruction: The Chang Gung Experience","Background: Using functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) for facial paralysis and postparalysis facial synkinesis reconstruction is our preferred technique. Gracilis was the first choice of muscle. Three motor neurotizers: cross-face nerve graft (CFNG), spinal accessory nerve (XI) and masseter nerve (V3) have been used as neurotizers for different indications. Methods: A total of 362 cases of facial reanimation with FFMT were performed between 1986 and 2015. Of these, 350 patients with 361 FFMT were enrolled: 272 (78%) patients were treated by CFNG-gracilis, 56 (15%) by XI-gracilis, and 22 (6%) by V3-gracilis. Smile excursion score, cortical adaptation stage with tickle test for spontaneous smile, facial synkinesis, satisfaction score by questionnaire, and functional facial grading were used for outcome assessment. Results: The CFNG-gracilis in a 2-stage procedure achieved most natural and spontaneous smile when longer observation (‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´¬¨¬®¬¨¬¢2 years) was followed. The single-stage procedure using the XI-gracilis has proven a good alternative. V3-gracilis provided high smile excursion score in the shortest rehabilitation period, but never obtained spontaneous smile. Conclusions: The CFNG-gracilis remains our first choice for facial paralysis reconstruction which can achieve natural and spontaneous smile. XI- or V3-gracilis can be selected as a save procedure when CFNG-gracilis fails. The V3-gracilis is indicated in some specific conditions, such as bilateral M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome, older patients (age, >70 years), or patients with malignant disease.",0,,1,0,1,9,2,1,0,10.1097/SAP.0000000000001327,Ann Plast Surg. 2018 Dec;81(6S Suppl 1):S21-S29. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001327.,"Chuang DC, Lu JC, Chang TN, Laurence VG.",2018,29668505,"Tools: Chuang's Smile Excursion Score Outcomes: synkinesis, smile excursion score, satisfaction score, ",362,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:cross-face,masseter nerve",,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Large Intratemporal Facial Nerve Schwannoma without Facial Palsy: Surgical Strategy of Tumor Removal and Functional Reconstruction,"Background: Three patients with large intratemporal facial schwannomas underwent tumor removal and facial nerve reconstruction with hypoglossal anastomosis. The surgical strategy for the cases was tailored to the location of the mass and its extension along the facial nerve. Aim: To provide data on the different clinical aspects of facial nerve schwannoma, the appropriate planning for management, and the predictive outcomes of facial function. Patients: Three patients with facial schwannomas (two men and one woman, ages 45, 36, and 52 years, respectively) who presented to the clinic between 2009 and 2015 were reviewed. They all had hearing loss but normal facial function. All patients were operated on with radical tumor removal via mastoidectomy and subtotal petrosectomy and simultaneous cranial nerve (CN) 7- CN 12 anastomosis. Results: Multiple segments of the facial nerve were involved ranging in size from 3 to 7 cm. In the follow-up period of 9 to 24 months, there was no tumor recurrence. Facial function was scored House-Brackmann grades II and III, but two patients are still in the process of functional recovery. Conclusion: Conservative treatment with sparing of the nerve is considered in patients with small tumors. Excision of a large facial schwannoma with immediate hypoglossal nerve grafting as a primary procedure can provide satisfactory facial nerve function. One of the disadvantages of performing anastomosis is that there is not enough neural tissue just before the bifurcation of the main stump to provide neural suturing without tension because middle fossa extension of the facial schwannoma frequently involves the main facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen. Reanimation should be processed with extensive backward mobilization of the hypoglossal nerve.",3,,0,0,0,5,2,1,0,10.1055/s-0038-1645868,J Neurol Surg A Cent Eur Neurosurg. 2018 Nov;79(6):528-532. doi: 10.1055/s-0038-1645868.

Pub-med,The split hypoglossal nerve versus the cross-face nerve graft to supply the free functional muscle transfer for facial reanimation: A comparative study,"Long-standing cases of facial paralysis are currently treated with free functional muscle transfer. Several nerves are mentioned in the literature to supply the free muscle transfer. The aim of this study is to compare the split hypoglossal nerve and the cross-face nerve graft to supply the free functional muscle transfer in facial reanimation. Of 94 patients with long-standing, unilateral facial palsy, 49 were treated using the latissimus dorsi muscle supplied by the split hypoglossal nerve, and 45 patients were treated using the latissmus dorsi muscle supplied by healthy contralateral buccal branch of the facial nerve.

Pub-med,Gracilis transplantation and temporalis transposition in longstanding facial palsy in adults: Patient-reported and aesthetic outcomes,"Background: In longstanding facial palsy, gracilis free functional muscle transfer (FFMT) is currently considered to be the gold standard in smile reanimation. An alternative to muscle free flaps is local muscle transposition, with the temporalis muscle transposition being the preferred procedure, because of its direction of pull when transposed. The present study aimed to compare outcomes of gracilis FFMT neurotised by the masseteric nerve and temporalis muscle transposition in longstanding facial palsy using patient-reported and aesthetic outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional comparison of gracilis FFMT and temporalis muscle transpositions was performed. Pre- and postoperative excursion measures were obtained. Patients were asked to answer a satisfaction questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire (FaCE scale) and a depression and anxiety questionnaire (HADS). Laypeople were asked to rate the pre- and postoperative aesthetic appearance. Results: Of 28 eligible patients, 10 gracilis and 12 temporalis patients participated. No significant differences were found between both groups in postoperative quality of life or depression/anxiety. Layperson observers judged the aesthetic appearance to be similar. Conclusion: In the present study, gracilis FFMT did not lead to superior quality of life and aesthetic outcomes compared to temporalis muscle transpositions.

Pub-med,The Distal Stump of the Intramuscular Motor Branch of the Obturator Nerve Is Useful for the Reconstruction of Long-Standing Facial Paralysis Using a Double-Powered Free Gracilis Muscle Flap Transfer,"Background: Double innervation of the transferred muscle with the contralateral facial nerve and the ipsilateral masseteric nerve has recently been reported by some authors. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of our procedure of double innervation of free gracilis muscle for reconstruction of long-standing facial palsy. Patients and methods: In our department, 6 cases of long-standing facial paralysis (4 cases of complete palsy and 2 of incomplete palsy) were reconstructed using a free gracilis muscle double innervated with the masseteric and contralateral facial nerves. The patient age ranged from 37 to 79 years (average 56.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 15.7). In our procedure, the intramuscular motor branch of the transferred muscle was identified and sutured to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve in an end-to-end fashion, and the obturator nerve of the transferred muscle was sutured to the cross-facial nerve graft, which was coapted with the contralateral facial nerve by end-to-end suturing. Results: All patients were followed up for >18 months and recovered their smiling function. The voluntary movement of the transferred muscle with teeth clenching was observed at approximately 4.7 months, and this movement combined with contralateral mouth angle elevation was observed at approximately 9.5 months after the surgery.

Pub-med,Simultaneous Reconstruction of the Lower Lip with Gracilis Functioning Free Muscle Transplantation for Facial Reanimation: Comparison of Different Techniques,"Background: Functioning free muscle transplantation is currently the gold standard for the reconstruction of facial paralysis, focusing more on the upper lip reconstruction rather than on the lower lip. This study aimed to compare different lower lip reconstructive methods when performing functioning free muscle transplantation for facial reanimation. Methods: A retrospective review of functioning free muscle transplantation for facial reanimation from 2007 to 2015 was performed. Patients were divided into three groups: in group 1 (n = 15), a free plantaris tendon graft anchored to the gracilis muscle was passed into the lower lip to create a loop within; in group 2 (n = 12), an aponeurosis tail of the gracilis muscle was attached to the lower lip; and in group 3 (n = 18), no suspension of the lower lip was performed. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up. Outcomes were assessed by photographs and videos, including subjective evaluation of midline deviation and horizontal tilt and objective analysis of smile dimensions and area. Results: A total of 45 patients were included. Results from the subjective evaluation demonstrate group 1 patients having the best improvement (overall score: p = 0.004 and p = 0.005, Fisher's exact test). The objective evaluation showed group 1 and 2 patients with better results compared with group 3 (horizontal component, p = 0.009; vertical component, p = 0.004; area distribution, p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Conclusions: Both plantaris tendon graft and gracilis aponeurosis achieved better improvement in subjective and objective evaluations than those who had no reconstruction of the lower lip. In particular, the plantaris tendon graft can achieve the most lower lip excursion with overall improved symmetry.

Pub-med,Facial Asymmetry Index: Validation and Applications in Various Smile Restoration Techniques,"Consistent and objective evaluation of the paralyzed face is imperative for documenting preoperative findings and assessing postoperative outcomes of reanimation techniques. Static and dynamic facial asymmetry are the key features of the paralyzed face. To date, there is no consensus among surgeons on how best to document facial asymmetry. The authors propose a Facial Asymmetry Index (FAI) as an objective measure of facial asymmetry and validate its use and reliability across numerous reanimation techniques. Frontal photographs of patients with unilateral facial nerve paralysis were analyzed. The length from the medial canthus to the ipsilateral oral commissure was compared between affected and nonaffected sides. The FAI is the difference between the two values, with a higher value reflecting poorer facial symmetry. Validation and reliability testing was then performed. There was a consistent decrease in the FAI with procedural intervention (FAI pre = 10.1, FAI post = 3.17; p < 0.0001).

Pub-med,Comparison of symmetry after smile reconstruction for flaccid facial paralysis with combined fascia lata grafts and functional gracilis transfer for static suspension or gracilis transfer alone,"Purpose: Facial paralysis has a profound impact on functionality and esthetics of the oral region. In patients with strong skin laxity and soft tissue ptosis, functional smile reconstruction is challenging due to the accentuated asymmetry at rest. Thus, the purpose of the study was to analyze facial symmetry in this patient clientele following a combination of dynamic reanimation with fascial strips for static suspension compared to functional gracilis transfer alone. Methods: In 2014, we altered the single-stage approach for microsurgical smile reconstruction in patients with significant soft tissue ptosis by adding fascia lata grafts for static support. We evaluated 6 patients (mean age 57.8 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 5.2, group A) who underwent the combined procedure, and compared their results to 6 patients with flaccid facial paralysis who were treated before 2014 and received a functional gracilis transfer alone (mean age 52.5 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 7.5, group B). To test the efficacy of the technique, we retrospectively analyzed the correction of the oral asymmetry as well as nasal and philtral deviation by computer-assisted photograph analysis 6 months postoperatively. Results: The comparative analysis revealed a significant postoperative improvement of the oral asymmetry (A: 90.0 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 5.0% relative correction at rest vs. B: 62.6 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 17.2%, P < .05), nasal (A: 0.4 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.2 vs. B: 0.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.4 mm, P < .05), and philtral deviation (A: 0.5 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.6 vs. B: 2.8 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.8 mm, P < .05) in group A.

Pub-med,Incomplete Facial Paralysis: The Use of the Ipsilateral Residual Facial Nerve as a Donor Nerve for Facial Reanimation,"Background: The reconstructive approach for incomplete facial paralysis is not yet determined. In this article, the authors present a new surgical approach for patients with incomplete facial paralysis in which residual, ineffective movement is detected preoperatively in the ipsilateral buccozygomatic territory of the paretic facial nerve. Methods: Sixteen patients with incomplete facial paralysis were found eligible for the procedure and underwent one-stage facial reanimation performed by the senior author (E.G.). Reanimation was performed using free gracilis muscle transfer with neural coaptation to an active facial nerve branch(es) responsible for the predetected buccozygomatic residual movement. Patients were reviewed in a systematic fashion using a combined still photographic and video scoring scale for symmetry at rest and at dynamic states. Results: Following surgery, improved symmetry was observed in the majority of observations of the mouth region at rest and while smiling and of the nasolabial fold region while smiling. There was no significant change in symmetry in the majority of observations of the eye region at rest and while smiling and the nasolabial fold region at rest. Video assessment of dynamic facial symmetry while smiling demonstrated improved symmetry in 91 percent of the observations (n = 191 observations). Comparison of mean scores for dynamic smile symmetry produced a statistically significant improvement of 1.68 points following surgery (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Based on this series, the authors recommend that use of the ipsilateral facial nerve buccozygomatic residual branch be considered as a donor nerve for facial reanimation using a free gracilis muscle transfer in patients with incomplete facial paralysis with residual preoperative movement in the miDFace.

Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation after radical parotidectomy between 2003 and 2016 was performed. Patient-reported quality of life (Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale [FaCE]), physician-reported facial function (""eFACE"" facial grading scale), and oral commissure excursion were compared preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Twelve patients were identified with prior surgery and adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy in 6 cases and chemoradiotherapy in 6 cases). Significant postoperative improvements were demonstrated for ipsilateral commissure excursion with smile (preoperatively: -2.2 mm [SD 2.3 mm] vs postoperatively: 7.9 mm [SD 2.5 mm]; P = .002), with meaningful smile achieved in 11 of 12 cases (91.7%).

Pub-med,Facial reanimation surgery in Mobius syndrome: Experience from 76 cases from a tertiary referral hospital in Latin America,"Introduction: M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome is defined as a combined congenital bilateral facial and abducens nerve palsies. The main goal of treatment is to provide facial reanimation by means of a dynamic surgical procedure. The microneurovascular transfer of a free muscle transplant is the procedure of choice for facial animation in a child with facial paralysis. Observation: Between January 2008 and January 2017, 124 patients with the syndrome have been approached at our institution. Distribution according to M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius Syndrome classification presents as follows: Complete M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome (n=88), Incomplete M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome (n=28), M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius-Like syndrome (n=8). Seventy-nine female and 45 male patients. Sixty-one percent have undergone a microsurgical procedure (n=76), in all of them, a free gracilis flap transfer was performed. Discussion: Our proposed treatment protocol for complete M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∞bius syndrome is determined by the available donor nerves. We prefer to use the masseteric nerve as first choice, however, if this nerve is not available, then our second choice is the spinal accesory nerve. For this purpose, all patients have an electromyography performed preoperatively. Overall, dynamic facial reanimation obtained through the microvascular transfer of the gracilis muscle have proved to improve notoriously oral comissure excursion and speech intelligibility.

Materials and methods: Seventeen patients were treated by static suspension using barbed sutures and all resulting changes were reviewed. The technique used for suture placement is described in detail, as are the author's tips for achieving the best esthetic and functional results. All patients had preoperative indication for physiotherapy and rehabilitation procedures (local massage and mirror therapy). Facial nerve function was evaluated using the Arianna Disease Scale. Results: The cosmetic outcome improved in all cases, with marked amelioration of the preoperative facial asymmetry. Oral competence was enhanced by elevating the oral commissure and reinforcing the cheek, and amelioration of symptoms related to lagophthalmos was achieved through increased support and decreased pull on the inferior eyelid. The addition of physiotherapy with specific rehabilitation exercises before the surgical intervention increased the success rate. Conclusion: This technique proved to be a good alternative to other static reanimation procedures because of its straightforward technique, availability, good outcomes, low complication rate, and ability to perform minor adjustments and corrections at any time.",0,,0,2,0,5,4,1,0,10.1016/j.joms.2017.07.176,J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2018 Mar;76(3):639-645. doi: 10.1016/j.joms.2017.07.176.

Pub-med,Quality of life and functional assessment of facial palsy patients: A questionnaire study,"Background: Facial palsy leads to functional and aesthetic deficits, which impair the quality of life of affected patients. General health-related and disease-specific questionnaires are available for quality of life assessment. In this study, observer-based analysis of facial function (Sunnybrook Facial Grading Scale) was compared patient-based to facial palsy-specific gradings (Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale and Facial Disability Index), and general health-related quality of life questionnaires (SF-36). We hypothesized that only facial palsy-specific instruments capture functional and social impairments of affected patients. Methods: Thirty facial palsy patients treated at a tertiary referral centre were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were unilateral facial palsy with stable facial function, age over 18 years and fluency in German. Facial function was assessed with general and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures and subsequently evaluated by the treating facial plastic surgeon. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics for all assessed measurements. Correlations were calculated to compare general and facial palsy-specific instruments, as well as observer-based grading. Results: Observer-based evaluation of facial function correlated well to the patients-based assessment of physical function, however social subscores did not correlate demonstrating the limited correlation of patient distress and facial nerve impairment. Physical function scores of disease-specific instruments did not correlate with general health assessment scores, while social function scores showed moderate to good correlations. Conclusion: Validated disease-specific instruments are essential for the assessment of facial palsy patients. Patient-reported outcome measures like the FaCE Scale and the Facial Disability Index should be applied in addition to standardized observer-based ratings to capture the patients' perspective on functional and social impairments associated with facial palsy to fully assess the burden of disease.",0,,0,0,0,5,2,1,0,10.1016/j.ijsu.2018.04.061,Int J Surg. 2018 Jul;55:92-97. doi: 10.1016/j.ijsu.2018.04.061.

Pub-med,Reanimation of the paralyzed lids by cross-face nerve graft and platysma transfer,"Alterations of facial muscles may critically humper patients' quality of life. One of the worst conditions is the reduction or abolition of eye blinking. To prevent these adverse effects, surgical rehabilitation of eyelid function is the current treatment choice. In the present paper, we present a modification of the technique devised by Nassif to recover lids from long-standing paralysis. In our modification, the upper lid is rehabilitated by a platisma graft innervated by the contralateral facial nerve branches using a cross-face sural nerve graft. The lower lid is pulled upward by a fascia lata string suspension. Fourteen patients with unilateral facial paralysis were operated on consecutively. For each patient, two sets of frontal photographs with open and closed eyes were available, before and after the surgical rehabilitation. On average, eyelid lumen with closed eyes decreased by 2.6 mm (SD 2.4) after surgical rehabilitation (37% of the initial value). With open eyes, the decrement was 1.5 mm (SD 1.6, 15%). The modifications were highly significant (p < 0.01), with very large effect sizes.

Pub-med,Surgical Refinement Following Free Gracilis Transfer for Smile Reanimation,"Importance: Gracilis free muscle transfer is widely regarded as the gold standard functional smile reanimation in long-standing facial palsy. Although most patients achieve meaningful oral commissure movement, a subset has suboptimal aesthetic outcomes due to miDFacial bulk or oral commissure malposition. Safe refinements that do not compromise excursion would be a welcome addition to the surgical armamentarium for this population. Objectives: The goal of this study was to describe surgical approaches to the 3 most common postoperative sequelae that detract from the final result after gracilis facial reanimation and to examine how these surgical refinements affect aesthetic outcome, smile excursion, and quality of life. Design: This was a retrospective case series. Setting: Tertiary care center (Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Facial Nerve Center). Participants: Of 260 gracilis transfers performed since 2003, meaningful excursion (>3 mm) but poor aesthetic outcome requiring additional surgery was noted in 21 patients and was related either to excess muscle bulk (9), resting inferior malposition of the oral commissure (9), or resting superior/lateral malposition of the oral commissure (3). Intervention: Specific surgical interventions to address each of these negative sequelae were developed and refined, to preserve muscle functionality but eliminate the unsightly feature. Main outcome: Aesthetic status, determined by miDFacial symmetry; quantitative smile excursion; and quality of life (using the FaCE instrument) were measured before and after revision. Results: Patients who underwent gracilis refinement directed at either muscle debulking, or gracilis tightening or loosening experienced significantly improved aesthetics/miDFacial symmetry and improved quality of life with no significant decrease in smile excursion.

Pub-med,Comprehensive approach to reestablishing form and function after radical parotidectomy,"Introduction: The reconstructive goals following radical parotidectomy include restoration of symmetry, reanimation of the face, and reestablishment of oral competence. We present our experience utilizing the anterolateral thigh (ALT) free flap, orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer (OTTT), and facial nerve cable grafting to reestablish form and function. Material and methods: From 2010 to 2016, 17 patients underwent radical parotidectomy followed by immediate reconstruction. An ALT was harvested to accommodate the volume and skin defect. Additional fascia lata and motor nerve to vastus lateralis (MNVL) were obtained. Anastomosis of the ALT to recipient vessels was performed, most commonly using the facial artery and internal jugular vein. OTTT was performed by securing the medial tendon of the temporalis to orbicularis oris through a nasolabial incision. Fascia lata was tunneled through the lower lip, then secured laterally to the temporalis tendon. The MNVL was cable grafted from either the proximal facial nerve or masseteric nerve to the distal facial nerve branches. ALT fascia was suspended to the superficial muscular aponeurotic system. Results: Average follow up was 19 months. Only one patient failed to achieve symmetry attributed to dehiscence of OTTT. All patients achieved oral competence and dynamic smile with OTTT activation. Facial nerve recovery was seen in 8 patients. 5 reached a House Brackman Score of 3. Two donor site seromas and two wound infections occurred. Conclusion: Simultaneous ALT, OTTT, and facial nerve cable grafting provides early reestablishment of facial symmetry, facial reanimation, and oral competence with minimal morbidity.",4,,2,3,0,1,2,1,0,10.1016/j.amjoto.2018.06.008,Am J Otolaryngol. 2018 Sep-Oct;39(5):542-547. doi: 10.1016/j.amjoto.2018.06.008.

Pub-med,Mixed facial reanimation technique to treat paralysis in medium-term cases,"Recent facial paralyses, in which fibrillations of the mimetic muscles are still detectable by electromyography (EMG), allow facial reanimation based on giving new neural stimuli to musculature. However, if more time has elapsed, mimetic muscles can undergo irreversible atrophy, and providing a new neural stimulus is simply not effective. In these cases function is provided by transferring free flaps into the face or transposing masticatory muscles to reinstitute major movements, such as eyelid closure and smiling. In a small number of cases, patients affected by paralysis are referred late - more than 18 months after onset. In these cases, reinnervating the musculature carries a high risk of failure because some or all of the mimetic muscles may atrophy irreversibly while axonal ingrowth is taking place. A mixed reanimation technique to address this involves a neurorrhaphy between the masseteric nerve and a facial nerve branch for the orbicularis oculi, to ensure a stronger innervation to that muscle, associated with the transposition of the temporalis muscle to the nasiolabial sulcus. This gives good symmetry in the rest of the miDFace, while smiling movement is achievable, but not guaranteed. This one-time facial reanimation is particularly indicated for those who refuse major free-flap surgery or when that may be risky, as in previously operated and irradiated fields. More extensive procedures based on utilizing a free flap to recover smiling, while adding a cross-face nerve graft to restore blinking, may be proposed for motivated patients. Between 2010 and 2015, five patients affected by complete unilateral facial palsy underwent this technique in the Maxillofacial Surgery Department, San Paolo Hospital (Milan, Italy). Symmetry of the middle-third of the face at rest and recovery of smiling was quite good. Complete voluntary eyelid closure was obtained in all cases. Combining temporalis flap rotation and a masseteric-to-orbicularis-oculi-facial-nerve branch neurorrhaphy seems to be a valid solution for those medium-term referred patients.",2,,0,3,1,9,2,1,0,10.1016/j.jcms.2018.03.003,J Craniomaxillofac Surg. 2018 May;46(5):868-874. doi: 10.1016/j.jcms.2018.03.003.

In this study we aimed to test a new method for assessing facial movements based on 3-dimensional analysis of the facial surfaces. Eleven patients aged between 42 and 77 years who had recently been affected by facial palsy (onset between 6 and 18 months) were treated by an operation based on triple innervation: the masseteric to temporofacial nerve branch, 30% of the hypoglossal fibres to the cervicofacial nerve branch, and the contralateral facial nerve through two cross-face sural nerve grafts. Each patient had five stereophotogrammetric scans: at rest, smiling on the healthy side (facial stimulus), biting (masseteric stimulus), moving the tongue (hypoglossal stimulus), and corner-of-the-mouth smile (Mona Lisa). Each scan was superimposed onto the facial model of the ""rest"" position, and the point-to-point root mean square (RMS) value was automatically calculated on both the paralysed and the healthy side, together with an index of asymmetry. One-way and two-way ANOVA tests, respectively, were applied to verify the significance of possible differences in the RMS and asymmetry index according to the type of stimulus (p=0.0329) and side (p<0.0001). RMS differed significantly according to side between the facial stimulus and the masseteric one on the paralysed side (p=0.0316). Facial stimulus evoked the most asymmetrical movement, whereas the masseteric produced the most symmetrical expression. The method can be used for assessing facial movements after facial reanimation.",4,,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,10.1016/j.bjoms.2017.11.015,Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2018 Jan;56(1):3-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bjoms.2017.11.015.

Pub-med,Modified Temporalis Muscle Flap for Eyelid Reanimation,"The reanimation of both upper and lower paralytic eyelids requires dynamic procedures for longevity of correction. Temporalis muscle ensures the criteria for reanimation and is used widely as a result. Many modifications were described to improve the success of the classical technique. One of these modifications was reported by the senior author in 1999. Twice as much muscle mass (in thickness) to the upper eyelid than the lower was taken and passed submuscularly 5 to 6 mm away from the limbus and a thinner split was passed subcutaneously beneath the lower cilia. The aim of this study was to present the outcomes of the technique after 38 operations with 37 patients and to describe deep temporalis musculofascial-fatty flap to recover depression of temporalis muscle split donor area. Seventeen lower eyelids were evaluated as mild, 12 were as moderate, and 9 were as severe ectropion. One upper eyelid was evaluated as mild, 14 were as moderate, and 23 were as severe lagophthalmos preoperatively. Mean follow-up time was 28.8 months. Five patients had mild ectropion and 2 patients had mild lagophthalmos postoperatively at last follow-up.

Pub-med,Immediate Hypoglossal-Facial Anastomosis in Patients With Facial Interruption,"Hypoglossal-facial anastomosis provides excellent motor supply to the mimetic muscles of the face when there is no chance of recovery of the damaged facial nerve. However, to achieve optimal results, the timing of facial nerve surgery based on electrophysiological testing and clinical evaluation requires close follow-up of the patient. Functional results after delayed surgery are not predictable and depend on the number of surviving fibers, type of injury, severity of damage, degree of infiltration of inflammatory cells, and local fibrosis. Facial hypertonia, synkinesis, and involuntary mass movement are the major problems of delayed reanimation of the facial nerve. Surgery in the vicinity of the facial nerve always aims to preserve neural integrity. However, immediate facial nerve grafting is sometimes required. We present our experience with 4 patients having normal facial function prior to surgery. The facial nerve was severed due to tumor infiltration and instantaneously reconstructed with the hypoglossal nerve. Two patients had House-Brackmann grade-II 10 days and 28 months after surgery, respectively, and another 2 patients had House-Brackmann grade-III facial paralysis 2 weeks and 6 months after surgery, respectively.",3,,0,0,0,9,2,1,0,10.1097/SCS.0000000000004150,J Craniofac Surg. 2018 May;29(3):648-650. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000004150.,Yetiser S.,2018,29283938,,4,6,28,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Triple innervation for re-animation of recent facial paralysis,"Recent facial palsies are those in which fibrillations of the mimetic musculature remain detectable by electromyography (EMG). Such fibrillations generally cease 18-24 months after palsy onset. During this period, facial re-animation surgery seeks to supply new neural inputs to the facial nerve. Neural usable sources were divided into qualitative (contralateral facial nerve) and quantitative (hypoglossus and masseteric nerve), depending on the type of stimulus provided. To further improve the extent and quality of facial re-animation, we here describe a new surgical technique featuring triple neural inputs: the use of the masseteric nerve and 30% of the hypoglossus nerve fibres as quantitative sources was associated with the contralateral facial nerve (incorporated via two cross-face nerve grafts) as a qualitative source in order to restore facial movements in 24 consecutive patients. The use of two quantitative motor nerve sources together with a qualitative neural source appears to improve re-animation after facial paralysis, despite earlier doubts as to whether patients could use different nerves to produce facial movements. In fact, movement was much improved. Smiling according to emotions and blinking seem to be better assured if cross-face nerve grafting is performed in two steps rather than one.",4,,0,0,0,9,8,1,0,10.1016/j.jcms.2018.02.014,J Craniomaxillofac Surg. 2018 May;46(5):851-857. doi: 10.1016/j.jcms.2018.02.014.

Pub-med,Differential Reanimation of the MiDFace and Lower Face Using the Masseteric and Hypoglossal Nerves for Facial Paralysis,"Background: Hypoglossal nerve transfer is frequently employed to reanimate the paralyzed facial muscles after irreversible proximal facial nerve injury. However, it can cause significant postoperative synkinesis because it involves the reinnervation of the whole mimetic musculature using a single motor source. Objective: To describe our experience with differential reanimation of the miDFace and lower face using separate motor sources in patients with short-term facial paralysis after brain surgery. Methods: Seven patients underwent combined nerve transfer (the masseteric nerve to the zygomatic branch and the hypoglossal nerve to the cervicofacial division of the facial nerve) and cross-facial nerve grafting with the aim of achieving a spontaneous smile. The median duration of paralysis before surgery was 7 mo and follow-up ranged from 7 to 31 mo (mean: 18 mo). For evaluation, both physical examination and video analysis were performed. Results: In all patients, reanimation of both the miDFace and the lower face was successful. A nearly symmetrical resting lip was achieved in all patients, and they were able to voluntarily elevate the corners of their mouths without visible synkinesis and to close their eyes while biting. No patient experienced impairment of masticatory function or tongue atrophy. Conclusion: Differential reanimation of the miDFace and lower face with the masseteric and hypoglossal nerves is an alternative method that helps to minimize synkinetic mass movement and morbidity at the donor site.",4,,0,0,0,9,8,1,0,10.1093/ons/opx217,Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown). 2018 Aug 1;15(2):174-178. doi: 10.1093/ons/opx217.,Yoshioka N.,2018,29088397,tools: clinical eval and video,7,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:cross-facial,masseteric nerve,hypoglossal",,Cross-facial nerve transfer,Masseteric nerve transfer,Hypoglossal nerve graft,,,,
Pub-med,Quantitative dynamic analysis of the nasolabial complex using 3D motion capture: A normative data set,"Introduction: Smile reanimation should be considered from a dynamic perspective. Any intervention should restore normality. To date no such normative dynamic data has been published. Aim: To quantitatively analyse maximal smiles between a healthy group of Caucasian male and female adults using 3D motion capture (4D stereophotogrammetry). Method: Using a 3D facial motion capture system 54 males and 54 female volunteers were imaged whilst performing a maximal smile. Eight nasolabial landmarks were digitised and tracked. Differences in displacement and speed of bilateral landmarks between males and females were analysed in each direction (x, y, z and Euclidian), from rest (T0), to median smile (T1) and maximal smile (T2), using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon-Signed Rank tests. Results: In males and females the displacement and speed of the left and right alar base landmarks were similar in the x and y directions but less in the z direction. For the philtrum, the displacement and speed of the bilateral landmarks were similar in the y and z directions, but less in the x direction. The left alar base and left philtrum moved significantly more in males. Left and right cheilion moved a similar amount in the x and y directions but more in the z direction. Labiale superius moved significantly more in the z direction, and labiale inferius moved significantly more in the y direction in males. In conclusion, this study has presented a novel normative data set of dynamic nasolabial complex movement for males and females during maximum smile.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation with masseter nerve-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer in established facial palsy patients,"Background: The masseter nerve is a useful donor nerve for reconstruction in patients with established facial palsy, with numerous advantages including low morbidity, a strong motor impulse, high reliability, and fast reinnervation. In this study, we assessed the. Results: of masseter nerve-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer in established facial palsy patients. Methods: Ten patients with facial palsy who received treatment from January 2015 to January 2017 were enrolled in this study. Three patients received masseter nerve-only free gracilis transfer, and seven received double-innervated free gracilis transfer (masseter nerve and a cross-face nerve graft). Patients were evaluated using the Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation software (FACEgram) to quantify oral commissure excursion and symmetry at rest and when smiling after muscle transfer. Results: The mean time between surgery and initial movement was roughly 167.7 days. A statistically significant increase in excursion at rest and when smiling was seen after muscle transfer. There was a significant increase in the distance of oral commissure excursion at rest and when smiling. A statistically significant increase was observed in symmetry when smiling.

Pub-med,Lengthening temporalis myoplasty and reduction of the swallowing oral phase dysfunction in facial palsy patients,"Introduction: Facial palsy can cause dysfunction in the oral phase of swallowing. Lengthening temporalis myoplasty is a widely used technique for correction of facial asymmetry in facial palsy. The aim of this study was to determine whether lengthening temporalis myoplasty could reduce the dysfunction in the oral phase of swallowing in patients with facial palsy. Materials and methods: This prospective study enrolled 13 patients undergoing lengthening temporalis myoplasty. Lip continence, bolus residue, and perceived disability before surgery and at 3 months and 6 months after surgery were compared. Lip force was evaluated with a manometric test and drooling with a self-administered questionnaire. Bolus residue was assessed visually. Perceived disability was evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Lip force improved significantly (from 58.23 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 23.35 mmHg to 91.15 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 18.36 mmHg; p = 0.001).

Pub-med,Microsurgical Reconstruction of the Smile: A Critical Analysis of Outcomes,"Background: Facial paralysis is a significant problem with functional, psychological, and esthetic consequences. Free muscle transfer for reanimation of the smile has been established as the preferred reconstructive method. However, little has been reported on the complications after this procedure. We sought to perform a critical analysis of these complications and their ultimate outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on consecutive patients undergoing microsurgical reconstruction of the smile by the senior author from 2013 through 2017. Patient demographics including age, race, body mass index, and medical comorbidities were recorded. The cause of facial palsy and type of microsurgical reconstruction were assessed. Patient outcomes including complications and management of the complication were analyzed. All statistical analyses were performed using nonparametric analyses. Results: We identified 17 patients who underwent microsurgical reconstruction of the smile, with 1 patient undergoing bilateral procedures, for a total of 18 microsurgical smile reanimation procedures performed. Sixteen of these were 1-stage reconstructions with the coaptation of the nerve to the masseter, whereas 2 were 2-stage reconstructions using cross-facial nerve grafts. The gracilis muscle was used as the donor muscle in all cases. The patients had a median age of 26.5 and a median follow-up of 1.04 years from surgery. There were no major early complications observed in our cohort. Eight (44.4%) reanimations developed a minor complication that required subsequent reoperation. The reoperations were performed at a median of 0.97 years after the microsurgical procedure. The most common indication for reoperation was lateral retraction of the insertion of the transplanted muscle, which occurred in 5 (62.5%) patients. One patient underwent surgical exploration for an abrupt loss of transplanted muscle function after trauma to the cheek. Another patient had less than expected transplanted muscle activity at 1 year postoperatively and underwent exploration of the cross-facial nerve graft and a neurorrhaphy revision. Lastly, 1 patient developed significant rhytids over the transplanted muscle secondary to tethering of the skin to the underlying muscle. This patient underwent 2 subsequent revisions, with placement of acellular dermal matrix between the muscle and skin and fat grafting. All patients had functional animation of the transplanted muscle postoperatively. Conclusions: Complications occurred in 44.4% of patients undergoing microsurgical reanimation of the smile. Most complications were minor in nature and were readily addressed with advancement of the transplanted muscle. All patients in our series had muscle function after the muscle transplantation.",1,,1,3,9,7,0,0,0,10.1097/SAP.0000000000001869,Ann Plast Surg. 2019 May;82(5S Suppl 4):S310-S312. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001869.,"Sue GR, Ho OH.",2019,30870177,"Tools: Outcomes: muscle excursion, complication leading to reoperation( hematoma, flap failure, major bleeding, infection), nerve transfers: cross facial and masseteric",8,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Neurorrhaphy for Facial Reanimation with Interpositional Graft: Outcome in 23 Patients and the Impact of Timing on the Outcome,"Objective: Neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft is a practical technique to achieve facial reanimation when the continuity of the facial nerve is interrupted and a large gap between the proximal and distal stump exists. The aim of this study was to report long-term outcomes of neurorrhaphy for facial reanimation with interpositional graft. The roles of some variable factors in the outcome of neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft were also evaluated and compared. Methods: A retrospective case series from a single tertiary referral center comprised 23 patients with facial nerve interruptions who underwent neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft using either end-to-end anastomosis or end-to-side hypoglossal-facial technique. Preoperative data (age, sex, primary lesion, interval from paralysis to surgery, facial nerve function), intraoperative data (surgical approach, graft and type of neurorrhaphy), and postoperative data (facial nerve function) were collected and analyzed.

Pub-med,Multivector functioning muscle transfer using superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle for longstanding facial paralysis,"Various donor muscles have been identified for restoring facial function due to longstanding facial paralysis. Donor muscles such as the gracilis and latissimus dorsi are frequently used and often produce one or two reliable vectors of force. However, there are drawbacks of using these muscles, including the instability of separating multivector functioning muscle units and limited amount of muscle contraction. Serratus anterior muscle transfer has the advantages of multiple independently functioning motor units that can be created with a single neurovascular pedicle. This article describes multivector muscle transfer using two or three superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle on a single neurovascular pedicle to produce an esthetic smile that is customized to imitate the function of the contralateral mimetic muscles. Twelve patients who had longstanding unilateral facial paralysis underwent muscle transfer consisting of multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle innervated by the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. The procedure had an uneventful postoperative course, and patients obtained excellent results, with sufficient upper lip excursion, mouth angle, and lower lip working simultaneously. Functioning muscle transfer using multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle is effective for treating longstanding facial paralysis.

Pub-med,Evaluation of Donor Morbidity following Single-Stage Latissimus Dorsi Neuromuscular Transfer for Facial Reanimation,"Background: Single-stage latissimus dorsi neuromuscular transfer has been a valuable option for dynamic smile reanimation. However, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the potential donor morbidity in such cases. The present study aimed to comprehensively analyze the donor morbidity following functional latissimus dorsi muscle transfer. Methods: Patients who underwent single-stage functional latissimus dorsi muscle transfer for smile reanimation between 2002 and 2016 were reviewed. Postoperative complications and functional impairments at the donor sites were evaluated. The Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire was used for assessing postoperative donor-site function. Results: Sixty patients, including 12 pediatric (18 years or younger) patients, were analyzed. Mean length of a harvested thoracodorsal nerve was 14.9 cm. Fourteen patients were treated with a dual innervation technique, in which both a descending and a transverse branch of the thoracodorsal nerve were harvested. Donor complications were observed in seven cases; all of them were seromas and resolved by simple aspiration. No other complications including scoliosis and sensory and/or motor disturbances in the upper extremities were encountered. Fifty patients responded to the Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire at a median follow-up of 51 months. The average score was 2.64, and all but three patients scored less than 10. No variables, including patient age (pediatric versus adult) and the use of a dual-innervation technique, affected the donor morbidities, including the functional deficits. Conclusion: Single-stage latissimus dorsi neuromuscular transfer for facial reanimation might be associated with a low rate of complications and minimal functional morbidity at the donor site.

Pub-med,Chimeric Vastus Lateralis and Anterolateral Thigh Flap for Restoring Facial Defects and Dynamic Function following Radical Parotidectomy,"Background: Extirpation of malignant tumors of the parotid results in creation of a complex facial defect often in combination with facial nerve palsy. This study presents the authors' experience using vastus lateralis muscle as a chimeric flap with anterolateral thigh flap to allow both soft-tissue reconstruction and dynamic reanimation in radical parotidectomy. Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of cancer patients who had undergone radical parotidectomy and reconstruction using a chimeric vastus lateralis and anterolateral thigh flap between March of 2013 and May of 2017 was performed using the Sydney Head and Neck Cancer Institute database. The return of dynamic miDFace movement was the primary outcome investigated. Electronic, clinician-graded facial function scale grades were used to formally assess postoperative outcomes. Results: A total of 27 patients were included in the study with an average age of 72 years (range, 31 to 88 years). Thirteen patients (48 percent) had developed dynamic function by the end of the study period. Young age predicted a more rapid return to dynamic function (p = 0.018). Both being a woman and having an intact facial nerve before surgery improved dynamic miDFace movement (p = 0.005 and p = 0.036, respectively). On multivariable analysis, superior miDFace dynamic function was associated with neurotization using miDFace facial nerve branches as opposed to using nerve-to-masseter alone (p = 0.05). Conclusion: The chimeric vastus lateralis and anterolateral thigh flap is a suitable option for restoring defects and dynamic function following radical parotidectomy.

Pub-med,Facial Nerve Translocation for Low Tension Neurorrhaphy to Masseteric Nerve,"Introduction: The techniques of facial reanimation are continually evolving in search of the ideal method for rehabilitating the paralyzed face. In the past, alternative cranial nerve motor nuclei have been used to power facial musculature. The trigeminal nerve is gaining popularity as a promising nerve to drive facial motion, particularly in the lower face. Objectives: This article describes a low-tension technique of using the transposed facial nerve to the trigeminal nerve (masseteric branch) for facial reanimation. Methods: Six patients over 2.5 years were treated with facial nerve translocation with division at the geniculate and direct neurorrhaphy to the motor branch of the masseter. Patients were evaluated by physical examination, measurement of oral commissure excursion using MEEI FACE-gram software, video assessment, Sunnybrook Facial Grading System, Facial Disability Index, and Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale (FaCE). Results: Patients demonstrated early motion within 4 months postoperatively and were placed into facial physical therapy. All demonstrated improvements in oral competence, strong oral commissure excursion with good symmetry, speech improvements, and variable results in facial tone. Synkinesis to the smile antagonists in the lower face was noted and treated with chemodenervation in three of six. No upper division synkinesis was noted. Conclusion: The motor branch of the trigeminal nerve is an effective option for facial reanimation via facial nerve translocation and end-to-end neurorrhaphy. Variable results in facial tone were noted with excellent oral commissure excursion. This procedure is safe in the reoperated mastoid.",4,,0,1,1,9,9,3,0,10.1097/MAO.0000000000002195,Otol Neurotol. 2019 Jun;40(5):e562-e565. doi: 10.1097/MAO.0000000000002195.,"Hetzler L, MacDowell S, Trahan J, Arriaga M, McDaniel LS.",2019,31083101,"MEEI FACEgram softwae, Sunnybrook Facial Gradig System, Facial Diability Index, FaCE Scale",6,,,,,Motor nerve,Trigeminal nerve transfer,,,,,
Pub-med,Spontaneity Assessment in Dually Innervated Gracilis Smile Reanimation Surgery,"Importance: Surgeons have sought to optimize outcomes of smile reanimation surgery by combining inputs from nerve-to-masseter and cross-face nerve grafts. An objective assessment tool could help surgeons evaluate outcomes to determine the optimal neural sources for smile reanimation. Objective: To evaluate the use of a novel video time-stamping method and standard outcome measurement tools to assess outcomes of facial reanimation surgery using various innervation strategies. Design, setting, and participants: Cohort study assessing the outcomes of dually innervated gracilis free muscle transfers vs single-source innervated gracilis transfer performed at a tertiary care facial nerve center between 2007 and 2017 using a novel, video time-stamping spontaneity assessment method. The statistical analyses were performed in 2018. Interventions: Dually innervated gracilis free muscle transfers or single-source innervated gracilis transfer. Main outcomes and measures: Spontaneous smiling was assessed by clinicians and quantified using blinded time-stamped video recordings of smiling elicited while viewing humorous video clips. Results: This retrospective cohort study included 25 patients (12 men and 13 women; median [range] age, 38.4 [29.3-46.0] years) treated with dually innervated gracilis free functional muscle graft for unilateral facial palsy between 2007 and 2017. Smile spontaneity assessment was performed in 17 patients and was compared with assessment performed in 24 patients treated with single-source innervated gracilis transfer (ie, nerve-to-masseter-driven or cross-face nerve graft-driven gracilis [n = 13]) (demographic data not available for NTM and CFNG cohorts). The use of time-stamped video assessment revealed that spontaneous synchronous oral commissure movement in a median percentage of smiles was 33% in patients with dually innervated gracilis (interquartile range [IQR], 0%-71%), 20% of smiles in patients with nerve-to-masseter-driven gracilis (IQR, 0%-50%), and 75% of smiles in patients with cross-face nerve graft-driven gracilis (IQR, 0%-100%). Clinicians graded smile spontaneity in dually innervated cases as absent in 40% (n = 6 of 15), trace in 33% (n = 5 of 15) and present in 27% (n = 4 of 15). No association was demonstrated between clinician-reported spontaneity and objectively measured synchronicity. Conclusions and relevance: Dually innervated gracilis free muscle transfers may improve smile spontaneity compared with masseteric nerve-driven transfers but not to the level of cross-face nerve graft-driven gracilis transfers. Quantifying spontaneity is notoriously difficult, and most authors rely on clinical assessment. Our results suggest that clinicians may rate presence of spontaneity higher than objective measures, highlighting the importance of standardized assessment techniques.

Pub-med,Facial muscle reanimation by transcutaneous electrical stimulation for peripheral facial nerve palsy,"Reanimation of paralysed facial muscles by electrical stimulation has been studied extensively in animal models, but human studies in this field are largely lacking. Twenty-four subjects with a peripheral facial nerve palsy with a median duration of three years were enrolled. We studied activations of four facial muscles with electrical stimulation using surface electrodes. In subjects whose voluntary movement was severely impaired or completely absent, the electrical stimulation produced a movement that was greater in amplitude compared with the voluntary effort in 10 out of 18 subjects in the frontalis muscle, in 5 out of 14 subjects in the zygomaticus major muscle, and in 3 out of 8 subjects in the orbicularis oris muscle. The electrical stimulation produced a stronger blink in 8 subjects out of 22 compared with their spontaneous blinks. The stimulation could produce a better movement even in cases where the muscles were clinically completely paretic, sometimes also in palsies that were several years old, provided that the muscle was not totally denervated. Restoring the function of paralysed facial muscles by electrical stimulation has potential as a therapeutic option in cases where the muscle is clinically paretic but has reinnervation.",0,,0,1,2,7,6,2,0,10.1080/03091902.2019.1637470,J Med Eng Technol. 2019 Apr;43(3):155-164. doi: 10.1080/03091902.2019.1637470.

Pub-med,Five-Year Experience with Fifth-to-Seventh Nerve Transfer for Smile,"Background: Masseteric- or deep temporal-to-facial nerve transfer (five-to-seven nerve transfer) is increasingly used in facial reanimation; however, the indications and clinical variables affecting outcomes for five-to-seven nerve transfer have not been defined. The authors describe their early experience with five-to-seven nerve transfer, reporting function and patient-reported outcomes, to identify potential parameters that are predictive of outcome. Methods: The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent five-to-seven nerve transfer for smile reanimation from 2012 to 2017. Age, sex, cause of facial paralysis, onset and duration of paralysis, history of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, donor nerve used, adjunctive procedures, and final excursion were recorded. Standard photographs and videos, and data regarding clinical facial nerve function and patient-reported quality of life, were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Sixty patients were identified. Forty-seven had flaccid facial paralysis and 13 had postparalysis facial palsy. Among flaccid facial paralysis patients, masseteric nerve transfer was successful in 30 patients (88 percent) and deep temporal nerve transfer was successful in three cases (60 percent). Among postparalysis facial palsy patients, five-to-seven nerve transfer was successful in two patients (20 percent). Average quality-of-life scores improved significantly from preoperatively (46) to postoperatively (59) among flaccid facial paralysis patients with successful five-to-seven nerve transfer. Conclusions: Five-to-seven nerve transfer is a viable option in facial reanimation. Shorter denervation times and preoperative flaccidity are favorable predictors of outcome. Five-to-seven nerve transfer as an adjunct to primary repair appears highly effective for enhancing smile function. Five-to-seven nerve transfer results are not reliable in patients with postparalysis facial palsy.

Pub-med,"Using the ""Sugarcane Chewing"" Concept as the Directionality of Motor Neurotizer Selection for Facial Paralysis Reconstruction: Chang Gung Experiences","Background: Facial paralysis and postparalysis facial synkinesis both cause severe functional and aesthetic deficits. Functioning free muscle transplantation is the authors' preferred method for reconstructing both deformities. Methods: From 1985 to 2017, a total of 392 patients underwent 403 gracilis functioning free muscle transplantations for facial reanimation. Different motor neurotizers were used: cross-face nerve graft (74 percent), spinal accessory nerve (17 percent), and masseter nerve (8 percent). Smile excursion score, cortical adaptation stage, patient questionnaire, Hadlock lip excursion, and the Terzis evaluation systems were used to assess outcomes. Results: For smile excursion score, the spinal accessory and masseter nerve groups showed higher scores than the cross-face nerve graft group in the first 2 years, but no difference by 3-year follow-up. For cortical adaptation stage, nearly all cross-face nerve graft patients achieved stage IV or V spontaneity, the spinal accessory nerve group achieved at least stage III (independent) movement, but individuals in the masseter nerve group achieved only stage III or less. The cross-face nerve graft group also achieved higher scores according to the Hadlock system and the Terzis evaluation system compared with the other two groups. Conclusions: The concept of ""sugarcane chewing"" where the sweetness is the least at the tail but the most at the head can be simply applied for surgeons and patients in weighing the benefits and drawbacks during the motor neurotizer selection. Cross-face nerve graft-innervated gracilis is analogous to chewing sugarcane from tail to head; despite lower outcome measures earlier, it yields the highest scores at 3 years postoperatively. Masseter-innervated gracilis is akin to chewing sugarcane from head to tail, with greater outcome scores initially but little improvement at longer follow-up. Spinal accessory-innervated gracilis results fall in between these two groups.

Pub-med,A comparative retrospective study: hypoglossofacial versus masseterofacial nerve anastomosis using Sunnybrook facial grading system,"Introduction: The aim of our study is to compare the functional results between two surgical techniques for reanimation of facial paralysis: hypoglossal-to-facial versus masseteric-to-facial nerve anastomosis. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 13 patients treated for complete facial paralysis in two medical tertiary centers. The patients were classified into two groups. First group: masseteric-to-facial nerve anastomosis. Second group: hypoglossofacial nerve anastomosis. Sunnybrook facial grading system was used to evaluate the functional results. The mean scores were compared using Mann-Whitney test. The correlation between the age at surgery, the delay in time from the onset of the facial paralysis to the time of surgery and the results of Sunnybrook scores was studied using correlation and linear regression. Results: No significant statistical difference was found between the mean of total score of the two groups (first group = 38 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 4.898, second group = 37.83 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 4.956). All the patients treated by hypoglossofacial nerve anastomosis presented with hemiglossal atrophy. We found slight superiority for the masseterofacial nerve anastomosis in dynamic movements, whereas at rest the hypoglossofacial anastomosis is slightly better. All the differences were not statistically significant. No correlation was found between the age at surgery (age range included 32-73 years) and post-operative results. No correlation was found between the delays up to 24 months from the onset of the facial paralysis and post-operative results. Conclusion: Our study showed that both types of anastomosis are effective with comparable results.

Pub-med,One-stage reconstruction by dual-innervated double muscle flap transplantation with the neural interconnection between the ipsilateral masseter and contralateral facial nerve for reanimating established facial paralysis: A report of 2 cases,"The authors developed a one-stage double-muscle reconstruction technique for facial paralysis using a latissimus dorsi (LD) flap and a serratus anterior (SA) flap, which were dually reinnervated by the contralateral facial nerve (FN) and ipsilateral masseter nerve (MN). The procedure was performed for 61-year-old man 3-years after resection of a malignant tumor and a 24-year-old woman 10-years after temporal fracture with facial paralysis. A double-muscle flap comprising left LD and SA flaps was harvested, a 15-cm thoracodorsal nerve (TN) section was attached to the LD flap, and 5-cm and 1-cm sections of the long thoracic nerve (LTN) were attached to the proximal and distal sides of SA flap. The LD flap and SA flap were sutured along the direction of motion of the zygomaticus major and risorius muscles, respectively. The contralateral FN and ipsilateral MN were interconnected by nerve suturing: the medial branch of TN to the distal end of LTN, the proximal end of LTN to the ipsilateral MN, and the buccal branch of contralateral FN to the main trunk of TN.

Pub-med,Neurotized Platysma Graft: A New Technique for Functional Reanimation of the Eye Sphincter in Longstanding Facial Paralysis,"Background: In 1984, Terzis reported on the potential use of a free platysma muscle transfer to reanimate the orbicularis oculi in longstanding paralysis of this unit. However, the vascularized platysma flap proved difficult to transfer, and this technique is not widely used today. In the present study, the authors have described the technique involving grafting of the platysma muscle to restore eyelid function and retrospectively discussed its clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective analysis included patients with longstanding facial paralysis who underwent orbicularis oculi reconstruction with neurotized platysma grafts. The authors have described the surgical technique and its retrospective clinical outcomes. Results: Between 1992 and 2015, 38 consecutive patients underwent this procedure; of them, 34 [16 men (47 percent) and 18 women (53 percent)] completed the follow-up. The time between the first and second surgical stages was a mean 8.6 months (range, 6 to 22 months). The surgical results were good in 18 patients (53 percent) and the recovery was satisfactory in 13 (38 percent). Conclusions: This study confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of grafted muscle functional recovery and the efficiency of neuromuscular neurotization. The presented surgical technique is safe and effective for treating longstanding facial palsy of the orbicularis oculi muscle. This is the only technique that is easy and reproducible, leads to facial nerve recovery, and places a similar muscle at the original site of the paralyzed muscle for functional recovery.

Pub-med,Facial nerve transfer for facial reanimation with parotidoplasty approach,"Background: Facial paralysis has a profound impact on quality of life in affected individuals, primarily through loss of verbal and nonverbal communication. Common facial nerve reanimation techniques include coaptation to the masseteric or hypoglossal nerve. Most techniques require nerve grafts to achieve a tension-free neurorrhaphy. Our report aims to show a surgical adaption to current facial reanimation procedures using a partial parotidoplasty approach in order to avoid challenges caused by interpositional nerve grafts through primary neurorrhaphy. Patients and methods: The modified surgical approach was performed on four patients, aged 30-67. Length of paralysis ranged from 6 to 13 months. Cause of paralysis included one patient with Bell's palsy in one patient, prior surgery in two patients, and traumatic fracture in the remaining patient. A modified Blair approach is used to expose the parotid capsule. The facial nerve is dissected proximally toward the stylomastoid foramen and distally toward the masseter. The parotid gland substance is sectioned overlying each branch of the facial nerve using ultrasonic dissection or hemostatic scalpel, allowing mobilization of the proximal segment and upper and lower divisions of the facial nerve. The superficial lobe of the parotid is preserved in most cases. The House-Brackmann (H-B) functional scale was used to assess facial nerve function pre- and post-operatively. Results: All patients showed H-B score V or greater prior to reanimation. Follow-up was conducted at 3-, 6-, and 12-months in all patients with resultant improvement of H-B scores of I in three patients and II in the remaining patient. Only one complication was noted, with one patient developing a right postauricular hematoma that was adequately managed without sequelae. All remaining patients experienced an uncomplicated post-operative course. Conclusion: Our modified approach to facial nerve reanimation works well with a planned parotidoplasty allowing for successful reanimation outcomes without the need for interpositional grafting.

Here we evaluated the functional outcomes of transferring the masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve to the facial nerve adjunct to facial nerve graft. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of seven patients who underwent facial reanimation surgery between 2014 and 2016. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of facial reanimation surgery: group A, masseteric nerve innervation with interposition graft; group B, interposition graft only. The postoperative resting symmetry and dynamic movement were compared. Results: Facial contraction was first observed in group A at 4 months and in group B at 7.3 months. Most of the patients achieved reliable resting symmetry; however, one patient in group B exhibited unsatisfactory facial weakness on the affected side. Group A patients showed better dynamic movement than group B patients. Eye closure, oral excursion and oral continence were better in group A than in group B patients. Smile symmetry in both groups was similar due to hyperkinetic movement in group A patients and flaccidity in group B patients. Conclusions: Dual innervation of the masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve improves the dynamic movement of paralysed facial muscles and shortens the recovery period in patients with iatrogenic facial palsy.",4,,0,2,1,9,6,2,0,10.1177/0003489419893722,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol. 2020 May;129(5):505-511. doi: 10.1177/0003489419893722.

Pub-med,Cryopreserved fascia lata allograft use in surgical facial reanimation: a retrospective study of seven cases,"Background: Facial palsy treatment comprises static and dynamic techniques. Among dynamic techniques, local temporalis transposition represents a reliable solution to achieve facial reanimation. The present study describes a modification of the temporalis tendon transfer using a cryopreserved fascia allograft. Case presentation: Between March 2015 and September 2018, seven patients with facial palsy underwent facial reanimation with temporalis tendon transfer and fascia lata allograft. Patients with long-term palsy were considered, and both physical and social functions were evaluated. The mean follow-up time was 21.5 months. No immediate complications were observed. Patients reported improvement in facial symmetry both in static and dynamic. Improvement was noticed also in articulation, eating, drinking, and saliva control. The Facial Disability Index revealed an improvement both in physical function subscale and in the social/well-being function subscale. Conclusions: This modified orthodromic technique allows to reduce the operative time and the risk of complications connected to the use of autologous tissues. The use of the cryopreserved fascia allografts from cadaveric donors seems to provide promising and long-standing results in the treatment of facial palsy.",0,,2,3,0,9,2,1,0,10.1186/s40902-020-0246-9,Maxillofac Plast Reconstr Surg. 2020 Feb 8;42(1):2. doi: 10.1186/s40902-020-0246-9. eCollection 2020 Dec.,"Silan F, Consiglio F, Dell'Antonia F, Montagner G, Trojan D, Berna G.",2020,32099836,"Tools: Facial Disability Index Outcomes:symmetry,improvement in articulation, eating, drinking, and saliva control temporalis tendon transfer + fascia lata allograft (count as 1 and 4 for ""other tissue""?)",7,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,['Fascia flap'],Fascia lata ,,
Pub-med,Changes in Electrical Activity of the Masseter Muscle and Masticatory Force after the Use of the Masseter Nerve as Donor in Facial Reanimation Surgery,"Introduction The masseter nerve has been used as a donor nerve for facial reanimation procedures due to the multiple advantages it offers; it has been generally considered that sacrifice of the masseter nerve does not alter the masticatory apparatus; however, there are no objective studies to support this claim. Objective To evaluate the impact that the use of the masseter nerve in dynamic facial reconstruction has on the electrical activity of the masseter muscle and on bite force. Materials and Methods An observational and prospective longitudinal study was performed measuring bite force and electrical activity of the masseter muscles before and 3 months after dynamic facial reconstructive surgery using the masseter nerve. An occlusal analyzer and surface electromyography were employed for measurements. Results The study included 15 patients with unilateral facial paralysis, with a mean age of 24.06 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 23.43. Seven patients were subjected to a masseter-buccal branch nerve transfer, whereas in eight patients, the masseter nerve was used as a donor nerve for gracilis free functional muscle transfer. Electrical activity of the masseter muscle was significantly reduced after surgery in both occlusal positions: from 140.86 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 65.94 to 109.68 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 68.04 ( p = 0.01) in maximum intercuspation and from 123.68 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 75.64 to 82.64 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 66.56 ( p = 0.01) in the rest position. However, bite force did not show any reduction, changing from 22.07 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 15.66 to 15.56 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 7.91 ( p = 0.1) after the procedure.

Pub-med,Split hypoglossal facial anastomosis for facial nerve palsy due to skull base fractures: A case report,"Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most prevalent causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The biomechanics of primary TBI involve a direct impact, practically extended to the base of the skull, and most of the skull base fractures (SBF) are identified in anterior and medial cranial fossa. Furthermore, those predicted in the medial area are related to fissures from temporal bones. Presentation of case: We report two cases of right facial nerve palsy initiated by SBF's, which were diagnosed and treated at our institution. The 3D CT evaluation in our first case showed a longitudinal fracture of the right petrosal bone, which was longitudinal and transverse for the second case. Two cases of facial nerve palsy were managed with split hypoglossal facial anastomosis to restore functional reanimation. All patients were adequately achieved after the procedure, and the hypoglossal nerve function was preserved. Conclusion: Split hypoglossal facial anastomosis technique was used to treat patients with facial nerve paralysis resulting from SBF's. This was to achieve good recovery outcome, in terms of facial reanimation and preservation of tongue function.",3,,0,0,0,7,2,1,0,10.1016/j.amsu.2020.08.056,Ann Med Surg (Lond). 2020 Sep 9;59:5-9. doi: 10.1016/j.amsu.2020.08.056. eCollection 2020 Nov.,"Prasetyo E, Oley MC, Faruk M.",2020,32983440,Tools: HB score Outcomes: facial movements nerve transfer: Split hypoglossal facial anastomosis,2,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,nerve transfer: Split hypoglossal facial anastomosis,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Predictive Value of Preoperative and Intraoperative Neurophysiology in Evaluating Long-term Facial Function Outcome in Acoustic Neuroma Surgery,"Objective: To determine the role of neurophysiological preoperative and intraoperative parameters in providing prognostic information regarding facial nerve (FN) function at 1 year after translabyrinthine acoustic neuroma (AN) resection surgery. Study design: Prospective observational study in a tertiary referral center. Patients treated via translabyrinthine surgical approach for sporadic AN microresection between December 2015 and 2018. Methods: Patients underwent preoperative (electroneurography-ENG, electromyography-EMG, and Blink Reflex-BR) and intraoperative (FN motor action potential-MAP and continuous EMG traces) neurophysiological studies. FN function was graded postoperatively at 1 year using House-Brackmann Scoring System. Results: Sixty-two patients were included in the analysis. Mean age was 53¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±10 years and average tumor diameter was 23 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 9 mm. At 1 year a normal facial function was observed in 68% of patients. In the univariate analysis a pathologic BR, low FN MAP values and ratios, and the presence of pathological neurotonic tracing (A-trains) on continuous EMG were associated with a poor facial nerve function outcome at 1 year postoperatively. Pathological preoperative BR testing and intraoperative A-trains showed a statistical significance also in the multivariable analysis, regardless of tumor size. Conclusions: Preoperative pathological BR testing and A-train activity on intraoperative EMG are correlated with poor FN outcomes at 1 year postoperative. This may provide important prognostic information to both patients and treating neuro-otologists. In the future this may guide preoperative and postoperative patient counselling and possibly optimize timing of facial nerve reanimation in selected patients.",0,,0,0,0,9,2,1,0,10.1097/MAO.0000000000002553,Otol Neurotol. 2020 Apr;41(4):530-536. doi: 10.1097/MAO.0000000000002553.,"Frigeni B, Bivona R, Foresti C, Guazzo E, Danesi G.",2020,32176144,"Tools:HB score Outcomes: facial nerve outcome, comparisson between preop EMG vs. Postop FN function  article discusses measuring facial nerve function - not surgical tx of facial nerve plasy",62,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Functional Outcome and Quality of Life After Hypoglossal-Facial Jump Nerve Suture,"Background: To evaluate the face-specific quality of life after hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture for patients with long-term facial paralysis. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed. Forty-one adults (46% women; median age: 55 years) received a hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture. Sunnybrook and eFACE grading was performed before surgery and at a median time of 42 months after surgery. The Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) survey and the Facial Disability Index (FDI) were used to quantify face-specific quality of life after surgery. Results: Hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture was successful in all cases without tongue dysfunction. After surgery, the median FaCE Total score was 60 and the median FDI Total score was 76.3. Most Sunnybrook and eFACE grading subscores improved significantly after surgery. Younger age was the only consistent independent predictor for better FaCE outcome. Additional upper eyelid weight loading further improved the FaCE Eye comfort subscore. Sunnybrook grading showed a better correlation to FaCE assessment than the eFACE. Neither Sunnybrook nor eFACE grading correlated to the FDI assessment.

Pub-med,Three-dimensional assessment of restored smiling mobility after reanimation of unilateral facial palsy by triple innervation technique,"The aim of this study was to assess surgically restored facial mobility using an optical 3D instrument. Eleven patients (age range 42-76 years) with unilateral facial palsy, treated by triple innervation procedure (masseteric and partial hypoglossal reinnervation, plus double cross-face facial grafting), performed five facial animations: rest position, smiling by contracting the healthy side, clenching the teeth, and pushing the tongue against the lower incisors and Mona Lisa smiling. These were recorded by stereophotogrammetry. Sixty healthy subjects were also recorded. The 3D reconstruction of each facial expression was registered onto the rest position scan, and the root mean square (RMS) point-to-point distance between the two 3D surfaces was calculated automatically for the facial thirds. RMS values on the rehabilitated hemiface were 74.8% (upper third), 46.6% (middle third), and 54.1% (lower third) of those recorded in healthy subjects. RMS values were higher in the middle and lower thirds than in the upper third, and during smile provided by masseteric stimulus (P<0.05). The rehabilitated hemiface differed more from healthy subject values than the healthy hemiface did (P<0.05). On average, patients were more asymmetric than healthy subjects (P=0.004).

Pub-med,Twenty-Five-Year Outcomes of Treatment of Irreversible Facial Paralysis with Gillies and McLaughlin Techniques,"Introduction: Data on treatment outcomes of surgical correction of irreversible facial paralysis is rare and long-term outcomes are scarce in the literature, making treatment choices difficult for operating surgeons. Objective: This study evaluated 25-year outcomes of treatment of irreversible facial paralysis with Gillies and McLaughlin techniques with a focus on general functional and age-related functional outcomes. Methods: Data of all patients who underwent surgical correction of facial paralysis using either Gillies or McLaughlin procedure between 1994 and 2018 were included in the analysis of this retrospective, single-centre study (n = 154). Results: Gillies surgery was performed on 12 and McLaughlin technique on 33 patients. Gillies and McLaughlin surgeries were associated with high patient satisfaction (75-86%), low complication rates (8-24%), and achievement of full or partial eyelid closure in 75% as well as smile reanimation in 97% of patients operated. Achievement of resting facial symmetry was low for both techniques and ranged from 27 to 46%. Age-related functional outcomes were generally superior in middle-aged patients (21-59 years) with fewer complications and reoperations compared to younger and older patients. Conclusions: Surgical correction with Gillies or McLaughlin dynamic muscle support techniques yielded good clinical results with high patient satisfaction and should, therefore, be included as a treatment option for facial reanimation of irreversible facial paralysis. Patient age may play a role in treatment outcomes and reoperation and complication rates and should be taken into careful consideration during treatment planning.",0,,0,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1159/000507634,ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec. 2020;82(5):245-256. doi: 10.1159/000507634.

Pub-med,Dynamic Brow Restoration Using a Soft Tissue Expander in Adult Patients With Arteriovenous Malformation,"Background: Impaired brow function in adult patients with arteriovenous malformation is a serious disability that can even influence the field of vision. Brow reanimation techniques are used to recover a more natural appearance and brow function. Many static procedures have been set to augment brow elevation, but only dynamic procedures can lead to better functional results. In this study, the experience of a single surgeon addressing the challenge of brow restoration with dynamic procedures is presented. Methods: A retrospective review was performed using the records of 4 adult patients who underwent dynamic procedures using a soft tissue expander for brow restoration after arteriovenous malformation excision in the unilateral site of the forehead with the expander on the contralateral side. Movement and electrodiagnostic examinations were performed postoperatively at 2 months. Results: The patients included 3 males and 1 female (mean age, 20.5 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 4.04 years). Brow improvement was noted in all patients.

A retrospective single-centre study of 154 patients with surgical correction of irreversible facial paralysis that underwent either Gillies procedure or McLaughlin or a combination of both techniques between 1994-2018 was conducted. Gillies and McLaughlin's combination was performed in 69 cases and was the most commonly used procedure in middle-aged and older patients. Operating duration and reoperation rates were highest in older patients. Comparison of middle-aged patients regarding the aspects patient satisfaction (p=1), complication rates (p=0.759) and reoperation rates (p=0.669) were all non-significant. Comparison of resting facial symmetry showed a trend towards significance at p=0.064 for patients aged 60 and above. Patient satisfaction was high at >77% for all three age groups and overall complication rates ranged from 0-14%.

Pub-med,Comparison of Lengthening Temporalis Myoplasty and Free-Gracilis Muscle Transfer for Facial Reanimation in Children,"Background: Lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM) and cross-face nerve graft with free gracilis muscle transfer (CFNG-FGMT) are the 2 most common procedures used to restore dynamic facial animation and improve facial symmetry. There has not been direct comparison or consensus. Here, the authors compare our experience with respect to muscle activity, symmetry, and excursion. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of patients with facial palsy who had CFNG-FGMT or LTM from 2008 to 2016 at a single institution. Postoperative surface EMG was recorded at maximum open smile. Normal and paralyzed sides of the face were analyzed with Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation software. Commissure excursion and symmetry was assessed. Results: Six patients with LTM and 10 with CFNG-FGMT met inclusion criteria. Muscle activity was 1st identified in LTM patients after 3 months (47.42 mV, P < 0.001) and CFNG-FGMT patients after 3 months (28.30 mV, P < 0.001) compared to immediate postoperative period. Relative to preoperative excursion, there was significant increase of 3.33 mm in commissure excursion seen at the 0 to 3 month period for LTM patients (P = 0.04). Commisure excursion for CFNG-FGMT was seen later, in the 3- to 6-month postoperative period (4.01, P = 0.024). During smile, CFNG-FGMT patients had better symmetry than unilateral LTM patients. In bilateral LTM patients, there was no significant change in symmetry. Conclusion: Dynamic facial animation improved in both surgical groups. The LTM demonstrates a faster rate of muscle recruitment compared to CFNG-FGMT. After 3 months, both LTM and CFNG-FGMT groups had comparable excursions.

Pub-med,A modified temporalis transfer technique for facial paralysis in elderly patients,"Introduction: In patients with chronic facial palsy where the treatment by conservative means or only nerve grafting is no longer an option, reconstruction by dynamic procedures such as pedicled and/or free muscle transfer is required. Patients and methods: Five patients with chronic facial palsy were treaded by temporalis muscle transfer to the eye and mouth simultaneously. In four of them, the combined Gillies-McLaughlin technique was used, but for the fifth one, a modified technique was applied. Results: In all patients, immediate and late postoperative clinical outcomes were satisfactory and improved their everyday quality of life. Discussion: Depending on the duration of the disease, there are different techniques that can be used. For the chronic facial palsy in elderly patients, the muscle transfer has better results, and a self-developed algorithm give us the opportunity to choose the best possible treatment for each one of our patients. The modified technique was found to be better with less surgical time, and recovery period for the patients. Conclusion: All the patients were satisfied with the results. For the fifth patient that the modified technique applied, the healing process was faster, and the aesthetic and functional reanimation achieved easiest, with no donor-site morbidity, comparatively with the rest patients where the standard Gillies-McLaughlin technique was used.",0,,0,1,0,4,2,1,0,10.1016/j.injury.2020.02.107,Injury. 2020 Dec;51 Suppl 4:S88-S92. doi: 10.1016/j.injury.2020.02.107.

Pub-med,Results of End-To-Side Hypoglossal-Facial Nerve Anastomosis in Facial Paralysis after Skull Base Surgery,"Introduction: The primary aim of facial reanimation surgery is to restore tone, symmetry, and movement to the paralyzed face. Hypoglossal-facial end-to-side anastomosis provides satisfactory facial reanimation in the irreversible proximal injury of the facial nerve. This study discussed the facial function results of end-to-side anastomosing of hypoglossal nerve to facial nerve when the injury occurred during skull base surgery. Materials and methods: The present study enrolled a total of 10 patients who underwent end-to-side hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after facial nerve paralysis due to skull base surgery. The data of the patients were gathered from hospital records, pictures, and movies during the 18 months of follow-up. Results: At the 18 months of follow-up, seven (70%) and three (30%) patients were reported with grades III and IV of the House-Brackmann scoring system, respectively. In total, out of the seven grade III patients, six subjects underwent early anastomosis (within the first year of the paralysis). On the other hand, among patients with grade IV, two subjects had late anastomosis. Conclusion: It seems that early end-to-side hypoglossal-facial anastomosis can be a favorable surgical option with good facial function results for reanimating the facial function of patients with facial paralysis following skull base surgery.",3,,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,10.22038/ijorl.2019.36294.2194,Iran J Otorhinolaryngol. 2020 May;32(110):133-138. doi: 10.22038/ijorl.2019.36294.2194.,"Dabiri S, Khorsandi Ashtiani M, Moharreri M, Mahvi Khomami Z, Kouhi A, Yazdani N, Borghei P, Aghazadeh K.",2020,32596171,Tools: HB scores Outcomes: end-to-side hypoglossal-facial anastomosis,7,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,end-to-side hypoglossal-facial anastomosis,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,M-Mode Echomyography of Facial Muscle Function Following Facial Reanimation with Temporalis Muscle Galea Pedicled Flap: Analysis of Ten Cases with Review of Literature,"Introduction: Facial palsy is a condition where the patients lack voluntary movement on the affected side of the face and are not able to convey their emotions. Besides that, they also succumb themselves to social isolation. Various techniques have been devised to overcome this devastating problem. The aim of this article is to evaluate and compare facial muscle function before and after facial reanimation with temporalis muscle galea pedicled flap by motion mode echomyography in patients with long-standing facial paralysis. Patients and methods: Ten patients with long-standing facial paralysis were included in the study (six patients with LMN palsy and four patients with facial weakness involving specific peripheral branches), and they subsequently underwent facial reanimation surgery with temporalis galea pedicled flap. These patients were followed postoperatively for a period of 1-2 years and were subjectively graded as excellent, good, fair and poor and objectively evaluated by M-mode echomyography, and the results were evaluated and statistically analyzed. Results: Subjectively, out of 6 patients with LMN palsy, results were graded as excellent in 2 cases, good in 3 cases, fair in 1 case, and out of 4 patients with weakness in specific facial nerve branches, the subjective results were excellent in 2 cases, good in 1 case and fair in 1 case. Objectively, the effect of transposed temporalis galea on orbicularis occuli, levator labii superioris and orbicularis oris was found to be statistically significant in patients with LMN palsy.

Pub-med,Suprazygomatic Aponeurotic McLaughlin Myoplasty for Facial Reanimation,"Background: Suprazygomatic aponeurotic McLaughlin (SAM) myoplasty technique for facial reanimation is based on the classical McLauglin's lengthening temporalis myoplasty with a series of new modifications. A comprehensive review of previously described other orthodromic temporalis myoplasty techniques is also included to give a succinct comparison. Methods: Twelve adult patients of facial palsy underwent SAM myoplasty for a period of 4 years. Three had congenital facial palsy, 4 patients had facial palsy secondary to acoustic neuromas, 3 were posttraumatic, and 2 patients had Bell's palsy. Results: Range of modiolus excursion achieved as measured at 3 months postoperatively on reanimation in our patients was 5 mm to 20 mm with an average of 12.6 mm. With SAM myoplasty technique, we were able to achieve excellent result in 4 patients and good results in 8 patients as evaluated with May and Druker scoring system. Conclusions: Suprazygomatic aponeurotic McLaughlin myoplasty for facial reanimation demonstrates a successful modification of the classical McLaughlin lengthening temporalis myoplasty, making it more customizable, simple, and predictable by taking the level of transection to the temporalis aponeurosis without the need for zygomatic osteotomy. A new classification of orthodromic temporalis myoplasty based on level of transections is also proposed for the first time. Good to excellent outcomes coupled with high patient satisfaction and low morbidity should make this technique popular among the facial reanimation surgeons.",0,,0,3,0,9,2,1,0,10.1097/SAP.0000000000002266,Ann Plast Surg. 2020 Aug;85(2):149-157. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000002266.,"Choudhary S, Khanna S, Mantri R, Arora P.",2020,32049759,"Tools: May and Druker scoring system Outcomes: modiolus excursion, nasolabial skin excision free gracilis muscle flap",12,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,"Association of Socioeconomic, Personality, and Mental Health Factors With Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Facial Palsy","Importance: Knowledge of factors associated with health-related quality of life in patients with facial palsy may aid in better interpreting outcomes of research and treatment. Objective: To identify factors associated with health-related quality of life in patients with facial palsy. Design, setting, and participants: The inclusion period for participants in this cross-sectional study at the University Medical Center Groningen, a tertiary referral center for facial reanimation surgery, was March 1 to June 1, 2019. Patients aged at least 18 years with facial palsy who had undergone surgery for facial palsy between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2018, and patients visiting the outpatient clinic of the University of Groningen Department of Plastic Surgery for their facial palsy between March 1 and June 1, 2019, were also asked to participate. Of 276 patients invited, 145 gave informed consent. Twenty patients did not respond after consent, 3 patients withdrew from the study, and 1 patient was wrongly included. Main outcomes and measures: Health-related quality of life was measured using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale and the Facial Disability Index (physical score and social score). Facial function was assessed with the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System. Other variables were investigated using validated questionnaires, including the Duke University Religion Index, Ten-Item Personality Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multivariable linear regression analyses with stepwise backward selection were performed to identify associations with health-related quality of life. Because 44 Sunnybrook composite scores were missing, a sensitivity analysis was performed that excluded the Sunnybrook composite scores from the multivariable analysis. Results: In total, 121 patients with facial palsy were included; their median age was 62 years (interquartile range, 48-71 years), and 63 (52%) were women.

Pub-med,Masseteric-Facial Nerve Anastomosis: Surgical Techniques and Outcomes-A Pilot Indian study,"Masseteric-facial anastomosis has gained popularity in recent days compared to the facial-hypoglossal anastomosis. Masseteric nerve has numerous advantages like its proximity to the facial nerve, stronger motor impulse, its reliability, low morbidity in harvesting and sacrificing the nerve and faster re-innervation that is achievable in most patients. The present case series demonstrate the surgical technique and the effectiveness of the masseteric nerve as donor for early facial reanimation. Between January 2017 and February 2019, 6 patients (2 male, 4 female) with iatrogenic unilateral complete facial paralysis (grade VI, House Brackmann scale) who underwent masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis were included in the study. The time interval between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 4 to 18 months (mean 8.5 months). In all patients pre-operative electromyography had facial mimetic muscle fibrillation potentials. All patients underwent end to end anastomosis except for one patient where greater auricular interposition graft was used. In all cases, the facial muscles showed earliest sign of recovery at 2-5 months. These movements were first noticed on the cheek musculature when the patients activated their masseter muscle. Eye movements started appearing at 6-9 months (in 3 cases) and forehead movements at 18 months (in 1 case). According to the modified House-Brackmann grading scale, one patient had Grade I function, two patients had Grade II function, and three had Grade V function. There was no morbidity except one patient who underwent interposition graft had numbness in the ear lobule. None of the patients could feel the loss of masseteric nerve function. Masseteric facial nerve anastomosis is a versatile, powerful early facial dynamic reanimation tool with almost negligible morbidity compared to other neurotization procedures for patients with complete facial nerve paralysis.",4,,0,3,10,7,2,1,0,10.1007/s12070-019-01758-z,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2020 Mar;72(1):92-97. doi: 10.1007/s12070-019-01758-z.

Pub-med,Masseter-to-Facial Cranial Nerve Anastomosis: A Report of 30 Cases,"Background: Facial nerve paralysis (FP) is a possible complication of cerebellopontine angle tumor surgery. Several donor nerves have been used in the past for facial reanimation. We report the results of 30 cases of masseter-to-facial anastomosis. Objective: To prospectively evaluate the efficacy of V to VII anastomosis after FP. Methods: In a prospective study, we included 30 consecutive patients with FP (20 women and 10 men) whose mean age was 48.8 yr (32-76 yr). In almost all cases, FP developed after cerebellopontine angle tumor surgery (29 patients), whereas in one case, FP occurred after skull base trauma. Pre- and postoperative evaluation of facial nerve function was performed using the House-Brackmann (HB) scale and the Sokolovsky scale, as well as by electromyography. Follow-up ranged from 11 to 51 mo and averaged 22 mo. Results: All patients achieved functional recovery of the facial nerve from VI to either III or IV HB degree.

Pub-med,The mini-temporalis turnover flap for miDFace reanimation: Photogrammetric and patient-rated outcomes,"Background: Mini-temporalis transposition (MTT) flaps, modified from Gillies' technique, have become less popular than temporalis tendon transfers for miDFace reanimation. MTT involves raising the middle third of the temporalis, transposition over the zygomatic arch and lengthening with deep temporalis fascia which is sutured to the orbicularis oris. Aim: This retrospective study assessed subjective and objective outcomes following MTTs by a single surgeon from 2009 to 2019. Methods: Operative and surgical details were recorded. Four blinded consultants rated pre- and postoperative videos according to Terzis' scale. Pre- and postoperative resting, Mona Lisa and canine smile photographs were analysed using Emotrics, the software that automatically computes differences in inter-landmark distances. Patients also completed the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) patient-rated outcome measure. Results: Forty-one patients (mean age 65.8 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 15.5) underwent MTT, median 3 (0.4-57) years post-paralysis and were followed up for median of 2.2 (0.4-8.8) years.

Emotrics analysis showed postoperative improvements in resting and dynamic symmetry of all indices, with the majority statistically significant (p<0.003). The mean GBI was 35.19 with 17 (94.4%) patients reporting improvement, whereas one (5.6%) patient reported detriment after surgery. Two (5.4%) patients suffered complications: one haematoma and one infection. Four patients (9.8%) required revisional flap tightening. No patients requested revisional surgery for temporal hollowing or zygomatic fullness. Conclusions: MTT effectively improves both subjective and objective resting and dynamic miDFace symmetry in a single stage.

Pub-med,Hypoglossal-Facial Side-to-End Neurorrhaphy With Concomitant Masseteric-Zygomatic Nerve Branch Coaptation and Muscle Transfer for Facial Reanimation: Technique and Case Report,"Background: Hypoglossal-facial direct side-to-end neurorrhaphy has become widely used for facial reanimation in patients with irreversible facial nerve damage. Although this procedure achieves good restoration of facial function, it has disadvantages such as mass movement and lack of spontaneity. Objective: To present a new facial reanimation technique using hypoglossal-facial direct side-to-end neurorrhaphy with concomitant masseteric-zygomatic nerve branch coaptation and secondary muscle transfer to reduce mass movement and achieve a spontaneous smile in patients with facial paralysis. Methods: This article describes a novel facial reanimation technique that employs hypoglossal and masseteric nerve transfer combined with secondary vascularized functional gracilis muscle transfer. Results: Details of the technique are reported in a patient with complete facial paralysis after brain surgery. The hypoglossal nerve was partially served and connected to the mastoid segment of the facial nerve by side-to-end anastomosis to restore facial symmetry. A nerve supplying the masseter muscle was coapted with a zygomatic branch by end-to-end anastomosis to restore voluntary movement of the oral commissure, as well as to assist with eye closure. A cross face sural nerve graft was connected to zygomatic branches on the healthy side. In the second stage, a vascularized functional gracilis muscle graft was transplanted using the cross face nerve graft as the donor nerve to restore a natural smile. Conclusion: Hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with concomitant masseteric-zygomatic nerve branch coaptation and muscle transfer is an alternative facial reanimation technique that reduces mass movement and achieves a natural smile.",4,,1,3,2,9,4,1,0,10.1093/ons/opaa128,Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown). 2020 Sep 1;19(3):E230-E235. doi: 10.1093/ons/opaa128.,Yoshioka N.,2020,32445574,"Positive Outcomes: symmetry, facial muscle tone hypoglossal nerve graft, a masseter muscle graft, and a sural nerve graft transplanted",1,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:masseteric nerve,hypoglossal,Sural nerve graft","hypoglossal nerve graft, a masseter muscle graft, and a sural nerve graft transplanted",Masseteric nerve transfer,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,Sural nerve graft,,,,
Pub-med,Comparative Study of 2 Different Innervation Techniques in Facial Reanimation: Cross-face Nerve Graft-Innervated Versus Double-Innervated Free Gracilis Muscle Transfer,"Recently, 1-stage double innervation with the masseter nerve and the CFNG has gained popularity owing to its outcomes of powerful and synchronous muscle contraction. In this study, we compared CFNG- and double-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT) for facial palsy reconstruction.A total of 49 patients with facial palsy who underwent facial reanimation surgery from August 2013 to January 2017 were enrolled. The CFNG group (18 patients) underwent 2-stage CFNG innervation, whereas the double-innervated FGMT group (31 patients) underwent dual coaptation with end-to-end masseter nerve and end-to-side CFNG. The FACEgram software was used for evaluating smile excursion, symmetry index, spontaneous smile occurrence, Terzis' score including palsy pathogenesis, and clinical progress.In the CFNG group, the smile excursion at rest increased (P = 0.000); however, there was increased smile excursion both at rest and during smiling in the double-innervated FMGT group (rest P = 0.002, smile P = 0.028). Improvement of the symmetry index was observed only in the FMGT group (rest P = 0.001, smile P = 0.000). There was no significant difference in Terzis' scores. The average time to the first visible muscle contracture was statistically significantly shorter in the double-innervated FGMT group (P = 0.035). With respect to spontaneous smile achievement, the double-innervated FGMT group (25.8%) showed a satisfactory outcome.Cross-face nerve graft-innervated FGMT improved only smile excursion at rest, whereas double-innervated FGMT provided improvement in both the resting and smiling postures. Furthermore, the double-innervated FGMT group showed a higher symmetry index.

Pub-med,Lipofilling of the upper eyelid to treat paralytic lagophthalmos,"Lagophthalmos is one of the most unpleasant and dangerous conditions that affect patients with facial palsy. The lack of ocular protection leads to corneal problems (such as conjunctival infections, acute and chronic keratitis, corneal ulcerations, and blindness). A dynamic reanimation of blinking eyelids is the therapeutic gold standard. However, success is not guaranteed with these dynamic techniques; even if results are good, blinking is usually restored within a year of the initial operation. Procedures that act more rapidly and have a higher success rate are needed. We proposed that lipofilling of the upper eyelid would improve eye closure, exploit the advantages of using autologous fat, and avoid the risks of exposure or migration associated with loading the lid with gold. Between 2012 and September 2018, we did upper eyelid lipofilling procedures for 75 patients with unilateral facial palsy. The main favourable result of lipofilling of the upper lid was the immediate improvement in corneal discomfort. Everybody described a partial to total increase in corneal comfort postoperatively. In the treatment of paralytic lagophthalmos, lipofilling of the upper eyelid produces favourable aesthetic and functional results, ocular health is restored, and the patients' quality of life is improved.",0,,0,0,0,5,3,1,0,10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.02.017,Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2020 Jun;58(5):558-563. doi: 10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.02.017.

Pub-med,Side-to-End Hypoglossal-Facial Neurorrhaphy for Treatment of Complete and Irreversible Facial Paralysis after Vestibular Schwannoma Removal by Means of a Retrosigmoid Approach: A Clinical and Anatomic Study,"Background: Facial paralysis secondary to a complete and irreversible anatomic or functional lesion of the facial nerve (FN) causes severe functional and psychological disorders for the patient. A large number of surgical techniques have therefore been developed for FN repair. Our objective was to propose a surgical FN reanimation protocol for patients with irreversible anatomic or functional postsurgical injury of the FN in the cerebellopontine angle after vestibular schwannoma resection. Methods: The clinical study included a total of 16 patients undergoing side-to-end hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy (SEHFN) since 2010, in which the FN injury was always secondary to vestibular schwannoma surgery in the cerebellopontine angle using a retrosigmoid approach. All patients had complete clinical facial paralysis at the time of the SEHFN. The anatomic study was conducted using 3 heads and necks (6 SEHFN). Results: Twelve months after surgery, FN function assessment with the House and Brackmann scale showed 2 patients with grade II, 13 patients with grade III, and only 1 patient with grade IV, and after 2 years, 4 patients had grade II, 11 patients had grade III, and 1 patient had grade IV. The average length of the anastomotic translocation portion of the FN in the anatomic study was 34.76 mm.

Pub-med,Long-term outcomes of Gillies and McLaughlin's dynamic muscle support in irreversible facial paralysis: A retrospective single-centre study with 25-year follow-up,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of Gillies and McLaughlin's dynamic muscle support with regard to functional outcomes and assess possible effects of comorbidities on both functional outcomes and reoperation and complication rates. A retrospective single-centre study was conducted in all patients (n = 154) who underwent surgical correction of irreversible facial paralysis from 1994 to 2018. Patients with either Gillies procedure or McLaughlin's dynamic muscle support or a combination of these techniques were included in the analysis. Data on reoperations, comorbidities, complications, functional outcomes and patient satisfaction were analysed. Sixty-nine patients had Gillies and McLaughlin combination, 12 patients had Gillies and 33 patients had McLaughlin procedure alone. Patient satisfaction was generally high (>80%) and highest when McLaughlin procedure alone was performed and in patients without comorbidities. Reoperations were performed in 80 patients (70%; mean 2.2 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.7) and complications affected 16 patients (14%).

Pub-med,Orbicularis Oculi Muscle Reinnervation Confers Corneal Protective Advantages over Static Interventions Alone in the Subacute Facial Palsy Patient,"Background: Corneal protection is a priority in flaccid facial palsy patients. Denervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle results in weak palpebral closure and predisposes patients to severe corneal sequelae. While periorbital static procedures enhance corneal coverage in repose, voluntary closure is only regained through dynamic reinnervation of the muscle. This study aims to elucidate the added effect of dynamic reinnervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle on long-term corneal integrity as well as on dynamic closure of the palpebral aperture. Methods: Retrospective review was performed on two groups of complete palsy patients: those who received solely periorbital static procedures and those who underwent concomitant orbicularis oculi muscle reinnervation and static lid procedures. Only patients with complete ophthalmic examinations were included. Corneal punctate epithelial erosions in addition to static and dynamic palpebral measurements were serially assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Of 272 facial palsy patients, 26 fit the inclusion criteria. Eleven patients underwent combined muscle reinnervation involving facial-to-masseteric nerve coaptation in addition to static eye procedures, and 15 patients underwent solely static interventions. Analysis revealed a 65.3 percent lower mean punctate epithelial erosion score in reinnervation patients as compared with static patients when evaluated at more than 9 months postoperatively (p < 0.01). Reinnervation patients were also found to have 25.3 percent greater palpebral aperture closure (p < 0.05) and 32.8 percent higher closure velocity (p < 0.01) compared with static patients. Conclusion: In patients with subacute facial palsy, dynamic reanimation of the orbicularis oculi muscle with concomitant static interventions provides lasting corneal protection not seen in patients who receive solely static interventions.

Pub-med,One-stage free transfer of latissimus dorsi-serratus anterior combined muscle flap with dual innervation for smile reanimation in established facial paralysis,"Microneurovascular free muscle transfer is the gold-standard surgical procedure for the reanimation of established facial paralysis. However, the innervation of the transferred muscle by the contralateral facial nerve is usually insufficient to produce a stable smile. Besides, the corner of the mouth sometimes moves unnaturally as if it were being pulled up because of the single-direction movement. Thus, we propose one-stage facial reanimation using free latissimus dorsi (LD)-serratus anterior (SA) combined muscle flap transfer with dual innervation. The LD-SA combined muscle flap was harvested with the thoracodorsal artery and vein as common vessels to move the corner of the mouth bidirectionally for natural smiling. The LD muscle was located in the same direction as the zygomaticus major muscle and reinnervated by dual innervation. The contralateral facial nerve was coapted with the thoracodorsal nerve, and the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve was inserted into the LD muscle by intramuscular neurotization. The 6th or 7th SA muscle was located in the same direction as the risorius muscle and reinnervated by neurorrhaphy of the long thoracic nerve and the thin branch of the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve. Since 2015, seven patients have been treated with this method without complications. On average, SA muscle movement was detected in voluntary biting at 3.1 months, and spontaneous smiling occurred 7.7 months after surgery. All patients developed a spontaneous natural smile. This method for established facial paralysis has the potential to improve the quality of the reconstructed smile and the unstable results of conventional single-innervation-single-muscle transfer.",6,Thoracodorsal + CFNG,0,1,0,9,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2020.01.032,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2020 Jun;73(6):1107-1115. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2020.01.032.

Pub-med,Sterno-omohyoid Free Flap for Dual-Vector Dynamic Facial Reanimation,"Background: Dynamic rehabilitation of longstanding facial palsy with damaged, atrophied, or absent facial muscles requires replacement of neural and muscular components. The ideal reconstruction would include a fast-twitch muscle that is small, a reliable donor vessel and nerve, and the potential to provide a natural, synchronous, dentate smile with minimal donor site morbidity. Many flaps have been successfully used historically, but none has produced ideal rehabilitation. Objective: To evaluate the novel sterno-omohyoid, dual-vector flap in rehabilitation of chronic facial paralysis. Results: We performed sterno-omohyoid free tissue transfer for smile reanimation in a 39-year-old male with a history of longstanding right facial palsy following resection of a skull base tumor several years previously. We transferred both muscles with the superior thyroid artery, middle thyroid vein, and ansa cervicalis. The patient developed a dynamic smile by 6 months postoperatively, and he had improved objective facial symmetry. Conclusion: Herein, we demonstrate the first use of the sterno-omohyoid flap for successful facial reanimation. Overall, it is a novel flap in facial reanimation with many advantages over traditional flaps, including the potential to produce a more synchronous, dynamic smile while adding minimal bulk to the face.

Pub-med,A nasolabial fold reset technique for enhancing miDFace lifts in facial reanimation: Three-dimensional volumetric analysis,"Despite successfully gaining excursion after free muscle transfer for facial palsy, soft tissue asymmetry, especially around the nasolabial fold (NLF) and medial cheek, is a troublesome problem in elderly patients. An NLF reset technique that enhances miDFace lifts has been introduced to overcome this problem. Our study included 43 consecutive patients who underwent facial reanimation surgery with free functional muscle transfer between March 2015 and July 2017. Of these, 20 patients underwent conventional procedures and 23 underwent our NLF reset technique. Postoperative oral commissure excursion and symmetry at rest and while smiling were quantified using FACEgram (Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation) software. To detect soft-tissue changes after surgery, three-dimensional analysis was performed using Morpheus¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫, a 3D, LED-based, white-structured-light scanner.

Pub-med,Long-term results of facial animation surgery in patients with Moebius syndrome,"Gracilis neuromuscular transplant is considered the gold standard for facial animation in Moebius syndrome patients. However, long-term evaluation of the results has not been critically examined in the international literature. Thus, it remains unknown how the transplanted flap changes with facial growth, and whether contraction (smiling) is maintained. Pediatric patients with Moebius syndrome who underwent facial animation surgery with at least 5 years of follow-up were retrospectively examined. Photographs taken at the 1-year and most recent follow-up visits were analyzed and compared using Emotrics software. Analyses focused on the rest position, and on gentle and maximum smiles. Eighteen patients were enrolled. Seven patients had bilateral and 11 unilateral Moebius syndrome; therefore, 25 gracilis transplants were analyzed. The latest follow-ups ranged from 5 to 13.2 years (mean 7.6 years). The three principal facial expressions that were examined did not differ significantly between 1 year and a mean of 7.6 years after surgery, but tended to improve in most patients. Commissure excursion and smile angle for the maximum smile did improve significantly (p = 0.002 and 0.029, respectively).

Pub-med,Dynamic smile reanimation in facial nerve palsy,"Objectives: Long-term facial paralysis results in degeneration of the distal nerve segment and atrophy of the supplied muscles. Options for these patients include free muscle transfer, temporalis myoplasty, and botulinum toxin injections for smile reanimation. In this study we aimed to evaluate the subjective and objective outcomes of these procedures. Materials and methods: In our study, we retrospectively analyzed smile symmetry in patients with facial palsy (n=8) who underwent facial reanimation procedures. Results: Subjective analysis showed high satisfaction in seven out of eight patients. Objective analysis showed statistically significant improvement postoperatively in both vertical and horizontal smile symmetry at rest and during maximum smile (P<0.001). Conclusion: Choosing the ideal procedure for the patients is the most critical aspect for facial reanimation. Though free muscle transfer is considered gold standard procedure, temporalis myoplasty also gives satisfactory results.

Pub-med,Evaluating Quality of Life After Facial Reanimation Using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale in a Series of Pediatric Patients,"Background: Facial palsy can have significant functional and psychological impact. Dynamic facial reanimation methods have provided means of restoration of smile. There remains a dearth of quality of life data in children. The authors aim to assess patient reported outcomes in this underreported population. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of pediatric patients with facial palsy who had dynamic facial reanimation from 2009 to 2017 at a single institution. Patients were sent a digital Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) questionnaire, a validated tool to assess patient quality of life. FaCE statements are grouped into 6 categories: facial movement, facial comfort, oral function, eye comfort, lacrimal control, and social control. Results: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. Fourteen successfully completed the survey. With normal function being 100, our cohort scored: facial movement 38.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 14.3; facial comfort 67.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 23, oral function 75 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 22.7, eye comfort 68.75 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 18.2, lacrimal control 53.6 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 32.5, social function 64.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 25.6.

Pub-med,One-Stage Simultaneous Augmentation of 2 Regions of 3 Facial Reanimations After Mid Skull Base Surgery by Using a Neurovascular Latissimus Dorsi Chimeric Flap,"We report a patient who underwent secondary reconstruction for facial paralysis involving 2 regions of augmentation and 3 facial reanimations using a neurovascular latissimus dorsi (LD) chimeric flap.A 53-year-old man underwent mid-skull base surgery for a chondrosarcoma at the temporomandibular joint and primary reconstruction using a free anterolateral thigh flap. At 28 months after surgery, he showed temporal and buccal depression and incomplete facial paralysis. We planned 1-stage reconstruction using a neurovascular LD chimeric flap, which was divided into dual compounds of the neurovascular muscle with soft tissue along the descending and transverse bifurcation of the thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle. We added adipose tissue to the muscle belly of the transverse branch using microperforators. We cut the transverse nerve 2.7 cm from the hilus and about 5 cm from the bifurcation, enabling the proximal stump of the transverse branch to be sutured to the ipsilateral buccal branch and function as a cross-face nerve graft. The transverse branch compound was placed on the temporal region and its neural pedicle was sutured to the zygomatic branch. The descending branch compound was placed in the buccal region and sutured to the contralateral buccal branch.At 58 months after surgery, good contour remained, and smiling was voluntary and natural. On needle electromyography, the zygomatic major muscle and the muscle transferred to the buccal region showed good contraction, and the muscle transferred to the temporal region provided tonus to the lower eyelid.

The authors report 3 cases of 1-stage reconstruction by transferring neurovascular chimeric latissimus dorsi (LD) musculo-adipose flaps, with satisfactory results. Methods: Three patients with depression deformity and DMs dysfunction after tumor resection in the perimandibular region underwent chimeric LD flap transfer. The flap comprised 1 portion with adipose tissue for augmentation, and the other contained muscle bellies with 1 or 2 neural pedicle (s) for DM reanimation. In case 1, the neural pedicle was sutured to the contralateral marginal mandibular branch. In case 2, the neural pedicle was sutured to the ipsilateral marginal mandibular branch. In case 3, the neural pedicle was sutured to both branches of the facial nerve. Results: All patients were satisfied with the deformity corrections. However, contractions of the transferred muscles varied. Case 1 showed insufficient contraction. Case 2 had excessive muscle contraction. In case 3, the muscle had double innervation, and well-balanced contraction was maintained for 3 years.

The authors present their rationale, surgical technique, and long-term outcomes. Methods: Between August 2012 and March 2016, 11 patients (6 female and 5 male patients) underwent a 2-staged dually innervated gracilis muscle transfer. Patients were evaluated with physical examination and needle electromyography. A standardized assessment of preoperative and postoperative photographs and videos was performed using Terzis' smile functional grading system at 48 months following surgery and the Emotrics software to assess improvement in symmetry over a 36-month postoperative period. Results: Voluntary contraction of the gracilis muscle was observed in all patients at a mean of 4 months and 4 days following muscle transfer. A spontaneous smile produced without teeth clenching was developed in all patients by 18 months postoperatively. Six patients achieved excellent and 5 good results. The difference between the averaged pre- and postoperative scores was statistically significant. With Emotrics, there were significant improvements in the smile angle, upper lip elevation, commissural excursion, and commissural height, with continuous improvement over 36 months. The postoperative electromyography (EMG) confirmed dual innervation of the gracilis muscle by the facial and masseteric donor motor neural sources.

Pub-med,Two-Stage Dual-Nerve Facial Reanimation: Outcomes and Complications in a Series of Pediatric Patients,"Background: In facial reanimation via microneurovascular muscle transfer, dual-nerve reinnervation of the muscle capitalizes on the synergistic effects of spontaneous motion from cross facial nerve grafting (CFNG) and increased excursion from masseteric nerve transfer. Two-stage approaches that delay masseteric nerve transfer until the time of the muscle flap increase spontaneity by maximizing muscle reinnervation from the CFNG. While this 2-stage, dual-nerve approach has been described in adults, we present a series of pediatric patients who underwent this reconstructive technique. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients who underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction with CFNG and ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfers. Procedures were performed between 2004 and 2016 by 2 surgeons at a single centre. Degree of facial paralysis before and after surgical intervention was measured using House-Brackmann scores. Results: Nine patients with a mean age of 8.6 (range: 5-15 years) years at time of surgery underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction. Average time between CFNG and transfer of the free gracilis with masseteric nerve transfer was 13.3 (SD 2.4) months. Mean follow-up was 27.3 months (SD 25.7). Patients demonstrated initiation of voluntary movement on paralyzed side by 3.6 months (SD 0.6) on average, with 3 patients demonstrating spontaneous movement at 3 months. Conclusion: The 2-stage, dual innervation technique using CFNG and delayed ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfer with a free gracilis is a promising reconstructive option to maximize spontaneous expression in pediatric patients.

We present the first detailed description and evaluation of a 2-stage technique, using first cross facial nerve graft and then the anterior belly of digastric muscle (ABDM), innervated by the cross facial nerve graft, to restore dynamic and spontaneous lower lip depression. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 2-stage lower lip reanimations between 2010 and 2018 was performed. Demographics, etiology, and operative details were recorded. Videos were graded pre/postoperatively using a 5-point Likert scale by 21 independent observers. Objective changes of symmetry were analyzed using Photogrammetry (Emotrics). Results: Twenty-seven patients were identified (median age 34.9 years, range 6-64). The mean duration between the 2 stages was 15.1 months. Follow-up ranged from 18-72 months. There were minor complications in 4 patients, and 1 case was abandoned due to insufficient length of anterior belly of digastric muscle. Average peer-reviewed scores improved from 2.1 to 3.2 (P < 0.05). Emotrics did not show improvement in static symmetry (P > 0.05). However, during open-lip smiling, lower lip height improved significantly (P < 0.05) whilst dental show improvements approached significance (P < 0.08). Lower lip symmetry was also improved during lower lip depression, as shown by improvements in lower lip height (P < 0.05), smile angle, and dental show (both P < 0.05). Conclusions: These results show the safety and efficacy of 2-stage lower lip reanimation using anterior belly of digastric muscle transposition.

Pub-med,Facial reanimation using the hypoglossal nerve and ansa cervicalis: a short-term retrospective analysis of surgical outcomes,"Background: Transferring the hypoglossal nerve to the facial nerve using an end-to-end method is very effective for improving facial motor function. However, this technique may result in hemitongue atrophy. The ansa cervicalis, which arises from the cervical plexus, is also used for facial reanimation. We retrospectively reviewed cases where facial reanimation was performed using the ansa cervicalis to overcome the shortcomings of existing techniques of hypoglossal nerve transfer. Methods: The records of 15 patients who underwent hypoglossal nerve transfer were retrospectively reviewed. Three methods were used: facial reanimation with hypoglossal nerve transfer (group 1), facial nerve reanimation using the ansa cervicalis (group 2), and sural nerve interposition grafting between the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerve (group 3). In group 1, the ansa cervicalis was coapted to neurotize the distal stump of the hypoglossal nerve in a subset of patients. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system and Emotrics software. Results: All patients in group 1 (n = 4) achieved H-B grade IV facial function and showed improvements in the oral commissure angle at rest (preoperative vs. postoperative difference, 6.48¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.77¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™) and while smiling (13.88¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 2.00¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™).

Pub-med,Free Functional Gracilis Flaps for Facial Reanimation in Elderly Patients,"Importance: The free functional gracilis flap (FFGF) is a versatile procedure in reanimating the paralyzed face, yet its application in seniors is limited by perceptions of morbidity and inefficacy. Objective: The study objective was to compare the morbidity and effectiveness of FFGF reanimation among senior and younger patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective chart review was performed on 20 consecutive patients aged 60 years and above (seniors) and 35 patients aged 40 years and below (juniors) who underwent FFGF for facial reanimation. Among this group, 16 senior and 22 junior patients with available long-term follow-up data were analyzed for functional outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures: The length of postoperative stay and postoperative complications were compared with assess immediate results. A second analysis for functional outcomes was assessed by resting and smile facial asymmetry index (FAI), as well as maxillary dental display to compare facial tone and lip excursion. Results: The average age of seniors was 67 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 5 years and that of juniors was 27 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 10 years.

Pub-med,Early Outcomes in an Emerging Facial Nerve Center: The Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Experience,"Objectives: Nerve transfer (NT) and free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT) are procedures for reanimation of the paralyzed face. Assessing the surgical outcomes of these procedures is imperative when evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions, especially when establishing a new center focused on the treatment of patients with facial paralysis. We desired to discuss the factors to consider when implementing a facial nerve center and the means by which the specialist can assess and analyze outcomes. Methods: Patients with facial palsy secondary to multiple etiologies, including cerebellopontine angle tumors, head and neck carcinoma, and trauma, who underwent NT or FGMT between 2014 and 2019 were included. Primary outcomes were facial symmetry and smile excursion, calculated using FACE-gram and Emotrics software. Subjective quality of life outcomes, including the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale and Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), were also assessed. Results: 14/22 NT and 6/6 FGMT patients met inclusion criteria having both pre-and postoperative photo documentation. NT increased oral commissure excursion from 0.4 mm (SD 5.3) to 2.9 mm (SD 6.8) (P = 0.05), and improved symmetry of excursion (P < 0.001) and angle (P < 0.001). FGMT increased oral commissure excursion from -1.4 mm (SD 3.9) to 2.1 mm (SD 3.7), (P = 0.02), and improved symmetry of excursion (P < 0.001). FaCE scores improved in NT patients postoperatively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Measuring outcomes, critical analyses, and a multidisciplinary approach are necessary components when building a facial nerve center. At our emerging facial nerve center, we found NT and FGMT procedures improved smile excursion and symmetry, and improved QOL following NT in patients with facial palsy secondary to multiple etiologies.",0,,1,0,,0,0,3,0,10.1177/0003489420957371,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol. 2021 May;130(5):459-466. doi: 10.1177/0003489420957371.

Pub-med,Nasolabial fold dynamics: Implications for facial paralysis and facial reanimation surgery,"Objectives: In patients with facial paralysis, facial reanimation surgery may be needed to normalize facial soft tissue function/movements. Critical for this normalization is the dynamics of the nasolabial folds (NLFs). The objective of this prospective, observational study was to determine the 3D morphologic dynamics of the NLFs in patients with unilateral facial palsy and normal subjects. Settings and sample population: 3D facial soft tissue movement data collected from adults with unilateral, facial paralysis (Bell's Palsy, n = 36); and (2) an age- and sex-frequency matched control group (n = 68). Materials and methods: Movement data were collected during repeated animations from participants using a video-based motion capture system. Movement in terms of displacement and asymmetry of the NLFs, nasal and circumoral regions were analyzed in the lateral, vertical and depth planes; as well as movement of the commissure and NLFs relative to the lower lip midline. Two-sample t tests were used to test for significant group differences. Results: Patients NLFs had less mean displacement, greater mean asymmetry and uncoordinated movements compared with the controls. For both groups during smiling, the NLF and commissure landmarks had approximately similar magnitudes of displacement (control range = 11-14mm; patient range = 7-10mm). Conclusion: NLF dynamics during smiling were as significant as oral commissure excursion. Thus, an immobile NLF is an unnatural feature of facial animations. Surgical treatments that address impaired NFL movements must be considered to create a more natural surgical outcome especially during smiling.",0,,0,0,3,9,1,2,0,10.1111/ocr.12400,Orthod Craniofac Res. 2021 Feb;24(1):62-69. doi: 10.1111/ocr.12400.

Pub-med,Haller's Ansa: An Unrecognized Route of Facial Movement After Skull Base Surgery,"A direct communication between the glossopharyngeal and facial nerves known as Haller's ansa exists in a minority of patients. Clinical manifestations of this anastomosis are not commonly observed. We describe post-operative facial movement with swallowing after facial nerve sacrifice in two patients who underwent surgery for skull base tumors. Patient 1, a 49-year-old male, received a transcochlear approach for resection of endolymphatic sac tumor and intratemporal facial nerve sacrifice without nerve reconstruction. Patient 2, a 23-year-old female, underwent surgery for left jugular paraganglioma, requiring facial nerve sacrifice and cable graft. Both patients had preoperative facial weakness and intraoperative preservation of the glossopharyngeal nerve. A literature review related to Haller's ansa was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus from 1920-2021. Post-operatively, both patients demonstrated oral commissure movement with swallowing, suggesting a communication between the glossopharyngeal nerve and the facial nerve (Haller's ansa). Although anatomical references to Haller's ansa exist, there are no reported clinical manifestations of this neural anastomosis. Glossopharyngeal-facial nerve communications may contribute to facial tone and movement. Pre- and post-operative assessment of facial nerve movement with swallowing may help assess for the presence of Haller's ansa. Better understanding of this neural anastomosis may have implications for facial reanimation surgery.

In this study, the authors set out to answer 3 questions: (1) are esthetic scores more dependent on the assessor or the person that is being assessed, (2) how does smile reanimation change esthetic scores, (3) do sex and age of the patient and assessor explain some of the esthetic outcomes?Thirty-five assessors scored pre and postoperative photographs of 21 facial palsy patients undergoing smile reanimation. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the effects of assessor and patient factors on esthetic outcome assessments, to examine changes after smile reanimation, and to determine whether sex and age explained part of the esthetic outcomes.Fifty-eight percent of variation in the esthetic scores can be explained by some assessors being more positive in their esthetic scoring compared to other assessors. Twenty-nine percent was attributed to patient baseline esthetic scores. Overall esthetic scores improved after smile reanimation. Sex and age of the patient and assessor could not explain variation in the esthetic scores.Esthetic appearance highly depends on ""who is looking.""

Pub-med,Dual-innervated multivector muscle transfer using two superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle for long-standing facial paralysis,"Recent reports have described several cases of double muscle transfers to restore natural, symmetrical smiles in patients with long-standing facial paralysis. However, these complex procedures sometimes result in cheek bulkiness owing to the double muscle transfer. We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with long-standing facial paralysis, who underwent two-stage facial reanimation using two superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle innervated by the masseteric and contralateral facial nerves via a sural nerve graft. Each muscle subslip was transferred to the upper lip and oral commissures, which were oriented in different directions. Furthermore, a horizontal fascia lata graft was added at the lower lip to prevent deformities such as lower lip elongation and deviation. Voluntary contraction was noted at roughly 4 months, and a spontaneous smile without biting was noted 8 months postoperatively. At 18 months after surgery, the patient demonstrated a spontaneous symmetrical smile with adequate excursion of the lower lip, upper lip, and oral commissure, without cheek bulkiness. Dual-innervated muscle transfer using two multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle may be a good option for long-standing facial paralysis, as it can achieve a symmetrical smile that can be performed voluntarily and spontaneously.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,2,3,0,9,4,1,0,10.5999/aps.2020.01599,Arch Plast Surg. 2021 May;48(3):282-286. doi: 10.5999/aps.2020.01599.

Pub-med,Facial Reanimation by Modified Intraoral Temporalis Tendon Transfer With Ancillary Procedures,"Facial nerve palsy is an exceedingly debilitating condition, incapacitating functional and aesthetic facets of the face. Orthodromic transfer of temporalis muscle is an easy and predictable technique which offers early animation of oral commissure and lower face. A retrospective chart review of 6 patients of facial palsy treated with orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer for facial reanimation is presented. The technique consisted of intra-oral coronoidectomy followed by attachment of fascia lata grafts from the coronoid to the commissure, the upper and lower lips via small cutaneous incisions. Contraction of the temporalis, pulls the fascia lata extensions thereby reanimating the lower face. 4 male and 2 female patients with an age range of 25 to 49 years were treated. Simultaneous fat grafting (2 patients), depressor labi inferioris muscle resection (2 patients) and wedge excision of nasolabial fold (2 patients) was done as ancillary procedures. Post-operative smile evaluation was carried out using the Terzis and Noah facial grading system. Patients were asked to smile with and without biting, and photographs and video were taken. The results were graded from 1 to 5 based on a 5-point scale (ie, poor, fair, moderate, good, and excellent) by an independent observer. The results were excellent in 1 patient (Terzis grading 5/5) and good in the remaining 5 patients (Terzis grading 4/5). Excursion of the oral commissure ranged from 6 to 10 mm. Our experience indicates that temporalis tendon transfer for facial reanimation has a short learning curve and provides early predictable outcome without significant complications.

This paper presents patient-rated outcomes (PROMS) in an 11-year series of both single and two-stage anterior belly of digastric muscle (ABDM) lower lip reanimations. Demographics, paralysis characteristics, operative details, and complications were recorded. Patients were telephoned and requested to complete the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) to assess patient-rated outcomes. Thirty-two patients were eligible (mean age 36.4 years). Twenty-one (63.6%) completed the GBI (mean score +33.3). More patients reported benefit than detriment (95.2% vs 4.8%). Complications were infrequent and included three cases of superficial infections and one of dermatitis. Four patients (12.5%) underwent minor revisions, mostly lipofilling of lip notches. The median (range) duration of follow up was 2.8 (0.3 - 8.5) years.

Pub-med,End-to-Trunk Masseteric to Facial Nerve Transfer With Selective Neurectomy for Facial Reanimation,"Objective: To examine functional outcomes following end-to-trunk masseteric to facial nerve transfer in patients with chronic flaccid facial paralysis. Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Tertiary-care private practice setting. Participants: Patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis of less than 24 months duration. Interventions: Direct end-to-trunk masseteric to facial nerve anastomosis. Outcome measures: Outcome measures included time to first movement, development of synkinesis, and an objective assessment of the resting tone and dynamic movement that was achieved. Results: Patient age at the time of transfer ranged from 6 to 61. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 24 months. No patients had any perioperative complications. No patient experienced significant mass movement or synkinetic facial movement with chewing. No patient had worsened chewing or swallowing. Patients have not yet recovered significant resting tone. All patients achieved smile activity when biting down with a median (interquartile range) oral commissure excursion of 7.57 mm (5.19-9.94 mm), starting 3 to 5 months after transfer. Conclusions: End-to-trunk masseteric to facial nerve transfer is a safe and effective procedure. Patients had rapid reinnervation with good excursion and achieved a natural appearing smile. The rehabilitated smile appears better than that achieved with hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer. The procedure can be performed coincident with cross-facial nerve grafting, and in some cases may produce dynamic facial movement that obviates the need for free muscle transfer.",2,,0,0,0,7,4,1,0,10.1097/SCS.0000000000007995,J Craniofac Surg. 2021 Nov-Dec 01;32(8):2864-2866. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000007995.,"Leader B, Griffin GR, Larian B, Massry G, Nabili V, Slattery W, Azizzadeh B.",2021,34727487,,4,3,5,,,Masseteric nerve transfer,,,,,,

Pub-med,Temporalis Tendon Transfer/Lengthening Temporalis Myoplasty for MiDFacial Static and Dynamic Reanimation After Head and Neck Oncologic Surgery,"Importance: Facial nerve paralysis is an unfortunate, yet relatively common sequela in the treatment of head and neck cancer. Static options for reanimation of the paralyzed miDFace and oral commissure offer limited quality-of-life improvement and may stretch over time. Reinnervation offers a prolonged recovery and may not be possible among patients with advanced cancer or in salvage situations. Objective: To determine the improvement in resting tone and dynamic excursion gained by use of temporalis tendon transfer (TTT) and lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM) for facial nerve reanimation among patients undergoing oncologic head and neck cancer surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: We present the largest series of primary and secondary TTT operations with prolonged photographic and video-based data with analysis enabled by FaceGram open-source quantitative methodology. This was achieved using preoperative and postoperative digital photographs of each patient at rest and full smile excursion. Using the JAVA-based program Facegram v1.0, measurements were taken of the oral commissure in relation to a line tangent to the inferior border of the lower lip. All operations were performed at the University of California, San Francisco, following oncologic resections between April 2011 and June 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Quantitative analysis of facial measurement with Facegram. Results: Of the 32 patients in our series, 19 (59.4%) were male and 13 (40.6%) were female. The average age was 71.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 10 years.

There was also a significant increase in static support at rest, measuring an average of 5.45 mm (p < 0.01, 95% CI: 2.56-8.33) and 2.71 mm (p < 0.04, 95% CI: 0.18-5.25) increase in affected oral commissure vertical and horizontal positions at rest, respectively. The average postoperative follow-up was 11.4 months (95% CI: 5.6-14.11). In addition, when compared with patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy (9 patients), those who received preoperative radiation (15 patients) had a significant improvement in the resting vertical height of the affected side (mean 5.32 mm (p < 0.05, 95% CI: 0.06-10.57)).

Consecutive cases of masseter nerve transfer patients within a patient database were evaluated from 6/2012 to 9/2017. Inclusion criteria were patients >18 years of age, with complete unilateral paralysis, receiving a masseter to facial nerve transfer, with at least 12 months of recovery, and possessing complete pre- and postoperative data. Patients were excluded if a simultaneous adjunctive procedure was performed so that tone could not be attributed to masseter transfer alone. The main outcome measure was the facial asymmetry index (FAI): the measured difference in distance between the medial canthus and oral commissure of the healthy and paralyzed sides. Results: Twenty-nine patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were further analyzed for this study. The oral commissure symmetry improved from 4.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 2.8 mm preoperatively to 2.2 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 2.3 mm postoperatively. In multivariate analysis, the preoperative FAI was the only significant predictive factor for improvement in commissure symmetry at rest (r = 0.589). This suggests that for each 1.0 mm of worse preoperatively oral commissure asymmetry, the improvement postoperatively was 0.6 mm. Age, gender, body mass index, side of paralysis, duration of paralysis, and recipient branch of facial nerve were not significant predictors in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Masseter to facial nerve transfer yields an estimated 60% correction in the oral commissure asymmetry. This estimation may be helpful in determining if adjunctive procedures should be utilized.",2,,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,10.1089/fpsam.2020.0195,Facial Plast Surg Aesthet Med. 2021 Jul-Aug;23(4):249-254. doi: 10.1089/fpsam.2020.0195.

Pub-med,The Role of Gold Weight Implants in the Management of Paralytic Lagophthalmos,"Background/aim: The study aims to evaluate the usage of gold weight implants and monitor complaints and comfort of patients. Methods: A hundred and ninety-one implantations performed between January 2009 and January 2019 were analyzed. Patient satisfaction was measured through telephone surveys. Results: Seventy-eight patients included in this study. The average follow-up time was 74,5 months. 93.5% of subjects had operational causes, among which the most widespread was acoustic neuroma (44.9%). The average time between facial paralysis and implantation was 141,1 days. Implantation was performed 26,6 days on average after acoustic neuroma surgery and 3,2 days on average after temporal zone malignancy surgery. Thirty-eight patients had their implants removed over either complication (n=14) or recovery (n=24). Recovery was the fastest after facial nerve decompression (mean= 4,75¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±3,6 (2-10) months) and the slowest after 7-12 cranial nerve transfer (mean= 18,3¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±8,2 (3-31) months). 26,9% (n=21) of patients had complications, of which the most common was extrusion (n=10). The overall satisfaction rate was 88,5% with the highest in visual acuity and the lowest in continuous requirement for artificial tear. Conclusions: The gold weight implantation is an effective, reversible, and easy procedure significantly reducing complaints regarding paralytic lagophthalmos. Early implementation may be beneficial for ocular complications.

Pub-med,Maximizing the Smile Symmetry in Facial Paralysis Reconstruction: An Algorithm Based on Twenty Years' Experience,"Over the last two decades, the senior author (B.H.) has had an extensive experience with facial paralysis reconstruction. During this period, the techniques have evolved substantially based on the experience and after observing and analyzing the surgical outcomes. The purpose of this article is to relay the lessons learned from the 20 years' experience and suggest an algorithm. In this retrospective study, we have included 343 cases of facial paralysis cases. Complete facial paralysis cases were 285 and 58 were incomplete facial paralyses, both requiring surgical procedures. Complete facial paralyses were divided in to short term (n = 83) and long term (n = 202). In total, 58% of the patients were women and 42% were men. The age range was 6 to 82 years. The techniques employed were direct suture, nerve grafts, cross-facial nerve grafts (CFNGs), masseteric-to-facial nerve transference, hypoglossal-to-facial nerve transference, free muscle transplants, and lengthening temporal myoplasty to achieve the best symmetry after reanimation of unilateral, bilateral, complete, and incomplete facial paralysis. The type of paralysis, objective measurements, the personal patient's smile, and the gender are key concepts to be considered before scheduling a dynamic facial paralysis reconstruction. For unilateral facial paralysis, the time of onset, the type of paralysis, the patient's comorbidities, and the healthy side status are some of the determining factors when selecting the correct technique. The preferred techniques for unilateral facial paralysis are direct repair, CFNG, masseteric-to-facial transposition, and free gracilis transfer. For incomplete facial paralysis, the masseteric-to-facial nerve transference is preferred. In bilateral facial paralysis, bilateral free gracilis transfer is performed in two stages using the nerve of the masseter muscle as the source of innervation. The authors provide an algorithm which simplifies facial paralysis reconstruction to achieve the greatest facial symmetry while thinking about the potential comorbidities and developing spontaneity smile according to the gender of the patient.",4,,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,10.1055/s-0041-1722905,Facial Plast Surg. 2021 Jun;37(3):360-369. doi: 10.1055/s-0041-1722905.

Pub-med,A Novel Flap for Dynamic Reanimation of Facial Paralysis: Microvascular Sternohyoid Muscle Free Flap,"The main objectives of facial reanimation procedures include restoring facial symmetry at resting state and regaining facial mobility. Static procedures usually provide unsatisfactory results, especially in younger patients. For this reason, over the years, several different surgical alternatives based on autologous, locoregional, or muscle free flaps have been proposed. The gracilis muscle is the gold standard technique for dynamic reanimation of long-standing facial paralysis. The excessive muscle bulk and the differences regarding the type of predominant muscle fiber were compared with the zygomaticus major force reconstructive surgeons to search for alternatives to the gracilis as a potential free flap for reanimation. One of them is the sternohyoid muscle flap. We report a patient with long-standing facial paralysis who underwent a dynamic facial reanimation by using a sternohyoid muscle free flap, thus proposing the procedure as an alternative to the conventional gracilis muscle flap.",0,,1,0,0,9,4,1,0,10.1016/j.joms.2020.10.036,J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2021 Apr;79(4):925-931. doi: 10.1016/j.joms.2020.10.036.

Pub-med,"Dynamic Facial Reanimation in an Overweight Patient and with Significant Comorbidities: An Objective Analysis of Labb‚àö¬Æ Technique
","Gracilis free muscle transfer is considered the gold standard technique for facial reanimation in cases of facial palsy. However, it is limited by its long operative and recovery times, the need for a second surgical site, and its outcomes that can sometimes show miDFacial bulk and oral commissure malposition. Facial reanimation with lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM)-Labb‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© technique- carries the advantage of having a shorter surgical time, a faster recovery, and being a less invasive surgery. Almost all patients included in studies of LTM were evaluated by subjective methods, and very little quantifiable data was available. A 64-year-old woman presented with long-standing incomplete right facial palsy secondary to acoustic neuroma surgery. Since she was overweight (body mass index [BMI]: 43.9) and had several cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia), she was not a good candidate for gracilis free muscle transfer. She was submitted to facial reanimation with LTM. Fourteen months after surgery, she presented excellent facial symmetry, both at rest and in contraction, while smiling. She was evaluated with the Facegram-3D, a technology that we have developed for dynamic evaluation of facial muscle contraction. The analysis showed symmetry at rest and contraction, according to Terzis and Noah. Regarding vertical and horizontal displacement, the postoperative movement was synchronized and with less fluctuations when compared with the preoperative period. Notably, the anatomical pair's trajectories were smoother. Similar velocity profiles were found between anatomical pairs, with less abrupt changes in velocity values, further supporting improved movement control. Comparing the symmetry index, which takes a theoretical maximum of 1.0 for perfect 3D symmetry, its value was 0.56 for the commissures and 0.5 for the midpoints in the preoperative period, having improved to 0.91 and 0.82, respectively, 3 months postoperatively. Good aesthetic and functional results were achieved using the Labb‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚àö√ú technique. LTM is a good option in cases of long-standing facial paralysis, if the patient desires a single-stage procedure with almost immediate dynamic function. Moreover, this technique assumes extreme importance in facial reanimation of patients of advanced age, overweight, or those who have several comorbidities.",0,,1,1,0,1,1,2,0,10.1055/s-0041-1736668,Surg J (N Y). 2021 Dec 15;7(4):e342-e346. doi: 10.1055/s-0041-1736668. eCollection 2021 Oct.,"Horta R, Frias F, Barreiro D, Ger‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ¬¢s A, Aguiar P.",2021,34926817,"tool: Facegram-3D

Pub-med,The Chimeric Scapulodorsal Vascularized Latissimus Dorsi Nerve Flap for Immediate Reconstruction of Total Parotidectomy Defects With Facial Nerve Sacrifice: Building a New Program and Preliminary Results From 25 Cases,"Background: Total parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice creates 2 challenging reconstructive problems: restoration of facial contour and facial nerve rehabilitation. Strong evidence suggesting that vascularized nerve grafts are superior to nonvascularized nerve grafts motivated our team to develop a chimeric scapulodorsal flap combining the usual harvestable local tissues with the vascularized latissimus dorsi motor nerve (SD-LDVxN). We present our experiences developing a new program at University of California, San Diego, highlighting our first case here, and present preliminary retrospective results focusing on the functional outcomes of facial nerve reanimation. Materials and methods: The first case performed in the United States was a 57-year-old woman with stage IVA left parotid adenoid cystic carcinoma and House-Brackmann grade 6 facial palsy. She underwent total parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice and a free chimeric SD-LDVxN flap reconstruction. She had an unremarkable postoperative course, and 3- and 6-month follow-up functional results are reported. Preliminary functional results from our total series of 25 patients were reported. Results: At her 3-month follow-up, she was a House-Brackmann 5 with a static eFACE score of 37, dynamic eFACE score of 31, and smile eFACE score of 48. At her 6-month follow-up, she was a House-Brackmann 5 with a static eFACE score of 50, dynamic eFACE score of 27, and smile eFACE score of 53. Preliminary results from our total series of 25 patients with an average of 5 years of follow-up were a House-Brackmann 2.5 and eFACE scores of 83.1 for static facial symmetry, 67.5 for dynamic facial symmetry, and 77.7 for smile score. Twenty of the 25 patients had postoperative radiotherapy. No local tumor recurrence had been reported. The average reinnervation time was 9 months and ranged from 3 to 15 months. Conclusions: The SD-LDVxN flap is a highly resourceful solution to reconstruct complex parotid defects, especially those that sacrifice the facial nerve. The vascularized nerve graft allows for primary facial reanimation. Nerve recovery may be superior to what could be expected with a conventional nerve graft.",0,,2,0,0,9,8,1,0,10.1097/SAP.0000000000002746,Ann Plast Surg. 2021 May 1;86(5S Suppl 3):S379-S383. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000002746.,"Li SS, Mangialardi ML, Nguyen QT, Orosco RK, Honart JF, Qassemyar Q, Kolb FJ.",2021,33976066,"questionnares and grading scale

Pub-med,The Anatomic Landmark Approach to Extratemporal Facial Nerve Repair in Facial Trauma,"Objective In this study, we aimed to examine the topical anatomic landmarks of the facial nerve (facial nerve areas) and their application in cases of extratemporal facial nerve injury in maxillofacial trauma. Materials and methods We analyzed 25 maxillofacial trauma patients with facial paralysis who underwent facial nerve reanimation surgery at the Ho Chi Minh City National Hospital of Odonto-Stomatology. The characteristics of each trauma case, including the mechanism of injury, the length of the facial injury, and the location/position of injury, were recorded. The association of the injured nerves with the trauma characteristics and the external landmarks of the facial danger zones was analyzed. Results The buccal branches had the highest rate of paralysis (22/25 cases), followed by zygomatic branches (15/25), frontal branches (11/25), marginal branches (6/25), and the main trunk (1/25). There were four areas related to the external facial nerve landmarks (facial nerve areas) that helped us find the affected nerves: wounds in Area 1 resulted in frontal branch paralysis in five out of eight cases (62.5%); wounds in Area 2 resulted in zygomatic branch paralysis in 8/13 cases (61.5%) and buccal branch paralysis in 12/12 cases (100%); wounds in Area 3 resulted in marginal branch paralysis in 5/10 cases (50%); and wounds in Area 4 alone resulted in main trunk paralysis in one out of four cases or at least two main branches in three out of four cases. Conclusion Extratemporal facial paralysis after facial trauma can be complex and highly variable, leading to difficulty in finding and repairing facial nerves. Thorough clinical examination and evaluation of trauma characteristics can aid in the identification of facial paralysis and repair. Mapping facial wounds using the four anatomic surface landmarks (Areas 1-4 as outlined in this research) helped us anticipate which branches might be traumatized and estimate the position of the distal and proximal endings to repair the nerves in all cases.",0,,0,0,0,0,7,2,0,10.7759/cureus.22787,Cureus. 2022 Mar 3;14(3):e22787. doi: 10.7759/cureus.22787. eCollection 2022 Mar.,"Lam AQ, Tran Phan Chung T, Tran Viet L, Do Quang H, Tran Van D, Fox AJ.",2022,35382176,sural nerve graft,25,,,"paper does not detail type of repair done, only states that patients had facial nerve repair","paper does not detail type of repair done, only states that patients had facial nerve repair",no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Artificial Intelligence-Driven Video Analysis for Novel Outcome Measures After Smile Reanimation Surgery,"Background: Since facial paralysis is a dynamic condition, the analysis of still photographs is not sufficient for measurement of facial reanimation outcomes. This study aimed at evaluating an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven software as a novel video assessment tool for smile reanimation surgery and at comparing it with the Terzis score. Methods: Patients with facial paralysis undergoing smile reanimation surgery between January 2008 and April 2020 were eligible for this retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were at least 6 months of follow-up and availability of both pre- and post-operative video documentation. The software output was given as intensity score (IS) values between 0 and 1, representing emotions/action units (AUs) that are absent or fully present, respectively. Results: During the study period, 240 patients underwent facial reanimation surgery, of whom 63 patients met the inclusion criteria. Postoperatively, the median IS of the happiness emotion and lip corner puller AU increased significantly (p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation of Terzis score with the IS of happiness emotion (r = 0.8) and lip corner puller AU (r = 0.74).

Pub-med,Management of facial nerve schwannoma: when is the timing for surgery,"Purpose: Although the estimated prevalence is extremely low, facial nerve schwannoma (FNS) is the most common primary tumor of the facial nerve (FN). In the present study, the outcome of surgical management in 18 patients with FNS was analyzed and an appropriate time for surgery was proposed. Materials and methods: A total of 18 patients with FNS who underwent surgical management by a single surgeon from 1999 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the 18 patients, five had no facial paralysis before surgery. Near-total removal was performed in three cases, and two cases were managed with decompression. In 13 cases with various degree of preoperative facial palsy, nerve continuity was lost during surgery. FN was reconstructed using cable graft in ten cases, direct anastomosis in one case, and facial-hypoglossal nerve transfer in one case. Facial reanimation surgery without FN reconstruction was performed in one case due to a long-standing facial paralysis before surgery. Preoperative House-Brackmann (H-B) grade in all patients was significantly worse as tumor size increased. The correlation was not observed between the duration and severity of preoperative facial palsy. Analysis of 12 patients who underwent FN reconstruction revealed that all patients with good preoperative facial function (H-B grade II-III) recovered to H-B grade III after surgery (7/7, 100%). However, patients with poor preoperative facial function (H-B grade IV or worse) had only a 40% (2/5) chance of improving to grade III after surgery. Preoperative tumor size and duration of facial palsy did not affect postoperative final facial function. Conclusion: We suggest that H-B grade III facial palsy is the best time for surgical intervention, regardless of the tumor size or duration of facial palsy.",3,,0,0,0,5,2,1,0,10.1007/s00405-021-06765-x,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2022 Mar;279(3):1243-1249. doi: 10.1007/s00405-021-06765-x.

Pub-med,Multiple Model Evaluation of the Masseteric-to-Facial Nerve Transfer for Reanimation of the Paralyzed Face and Quick Prognostic Prediction,"Facial paralysis is negatively associated with functional, aesthetic, and psychosocial consequences. The masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer (MFNT) has many advantages in facial reanimation. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of our MFNT technique and define the potential factors predictive of outcome. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients who underwent MFNT using the temporofacial trunk of facial nerve. Videotapes and images were documented and evaluated according to Facial Nerve Grading Scale 2.0 (FNGS2.0) and Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (FGS). The quality-of-life was obtained using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale. Moreover, Facial Asymmetry Index (FAI), quantitative measurement of the width of palpebral fissure, deviation of the philtrum, and angles or excursions of the oral commissure were applied to explore the effect of the transfer metrically. Multivariable logistic regression models and Cox regression were prepared to predict the effect of MFNT by preoperative clinical features. The patients showed favorable outcomes graded by FNGS2.0, and experienced significantly improved scores in static and dynamic symmetry with slightly elevated scores in synkinesis evaluated by the Sunnybrook FGS. The score of FaCE Scale increased in all domains after reanimation. The quantitative indices indicated the symmetry restoration of the middle and lower face after MFNT. Regression analysis revealed that younger patients with severe facial paralysis are preferable to receive MFNT early for faster and better recovery, especially for traumatic causes. The findings demonstrate that MFNT is an effective technique for facial reanimation, and case screening based on clinical characteristics could be useful for surgical recommendation.",2,,0,0,9,9,8,1,0,10.3389/fsurg.2022.735231,Front Surg. 2022 Mar 15;9:735231. doi: 10.3389/fsurg.2022.735231. eCollection 2022.,"Li T, Liu Y, Zhang S, Yang W, Zuo M, Liu X.",2022,35372492,"Tools: Facial Nerve Grading Scale, Sunnybrook Facial Grading System, FaCE, Facial Asymmetry Index, FNGS2.0 Outcomes: quality of life, width of palpebral fissure, deviation of the philtrum, excursion of the orl commissure, symmetry restoration, infections, ocular discomfort",20,,,,,Masseteric nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,Minimally invasive temporalis tendon transposition and upper lid lipofilling for immediate and secondary facial reanimation in patients treated for malignant tumors of the parotid gland,"Treatment for facial nerve-invading parotid malignancies usually results in complete facial palsy. The authors present a novel technique to treat facial palsy following radical parotid surgery and retrospectively evaluate results in terms of soft tissue symmetry at rest and during smiling and eyelid closure using the eFACE system. 9 patients with facial palsy following parotid malignancies resection or undergoing parotidectomy with planned facial nerve resection for tumor invasion were treated with the association of mini-invasive temporalis flap rotation and upper lid lipofilling to restore symmetry of the middle facial third at rest and during smiling and eyelid closure. The technique was employed during the same surgical session as the tumor removal or for secondary facial reanimation. Systematic eFACE evaluation demonstrated significant improvement in static nasolabial fold depth orientation and oral commissure position, palpebral fissure narrowing during eye closure, and oral commissure movement and nasolabial fold depth and orientation with smile (p respectively .008, .011, 0.008, 0.035, 0.011, 0.008, and 0.011, Wilcoxon's test).

Pub-med,Facial reanimation with interposition nerve graft or masseter nerve transfer: a comparative retrospective study,"Both interposition nerve grafts and masseter nerve transfers have been successfully used for facial reanimation after irreversible injuries to the cranial portion of the facial nerve. However, no comparative study of these two procedures has yet been reported. In this two-site, two-arm, retrospective case review study, 32 patients were included. Of these, 17 patients (eight men and nine women, mean age 42.1 years) underwent interposition nerve graft after tumor extirpation or trauma between 2003 and 2006 in the Ear Institute, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, and 15 patients (six men and nine women, mean age 40.6 years) underwent masseter-to-facial nerve transfer after tumor extirpation or trauma between November 2010 and February 2016 in Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, China. More patients achieved House-Brackmann III recovery after masseter nerve repair than interposition nerve graft repair (15/15 vs. 12/17). The mean oral commissure excursion ratio was also higher in patients who underwent masseter nerve transfer than in patients subjected to an interposition nerve graft. These findings suggest that masseter nerve transfer results in strong oral commissure excursion, avoiding obvious synkinesis, while an interposition nerve graft provides better resting symmetry.

Pub-med,Sternocleidomastoid Muscle Transfer for Treatment of Longstanding Facial Paralysis: Long-term Outcomes and Complications,"Background/aim: The use of sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) flap for facial reanimation was established in the 1980s by the senior author of this paper. We aimed to analyze long-term outcome and complications of this procedure. Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing SCM reanimation for longstanding facial palsy between January 2009 and December 2015. Patients with follow-up longer than 12 months (range=12-96) were included in the study. Facial muscle function was evaluated before and at each follow-up after the surgery with the House-Brackmann (HB) scale-facial nerve grading system and Facegram analysis. Donor site morbidity and overall complication rates were documented and analyzed. Results: Forty-two patients aged 18-66 years (mean age=37) with a mean duration of facial palsy of 5 years (range=2-48) met the inclusion criteria. The HB score 2 years after surgery improved significantly (p<0.05) in comparison to the pre-operative condition (3.6 vs. 4.7). Twelve months after surgery, oral commissure excursion improved by mean 8.95 mm. No flap necrosis occurred, nor compromise of neck and shoulder function despite an obvious contour defect in the SCM donor site. None of the patients presented head posture or movement issues. Conclusion: The SCM flap transfer is a reliable and effective procedure to achieve moderate improvement of the oral commissure excursion using a local method with moderate donor site morbidity. It can be regarded as a valuable option for dynamic facial reanimation in case of longstanding facial palsy.",0,,0,1,10,9,8,3,0,10.21873/invivo.12731,In Vivo. 2022 Jan-Feb;36(1):501-509. doi: 10.21873/invivo.12731.,"Wang W, Cai Y, Oranges CM, Kalbermatten DF, Schaefer DJ, Yang C, Li W.",2022,34972755,Negative Outcomes: bulkiness in cheek,42,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,
Pub-med,"Smile Outcomes of an Externally Scarless, Intraoral Orthodromic Temporalis Tendon Transfer","Background: Temporalis tendon transfer (TTT) often relies on external incisions in the nasolabial fold, temporal region, or both. Herein, we studied smile outcomes of a TTT technique via a single intraoral incision without external skin incisions. Objective: To measure the difference in static perioral positions before and after intraoral TTT. Methods: Five patients underwent an externally scarless TTT technique via an intraoral approach. Iris measurements were used to estimate pixel-to-millimeter conversion for facial analysis of vertical and horizontal oral commissure excursion vectors using the JAVA-based program Facegram version 1.0 (Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary). Results: After surgery, mean vertical height on the affected side significantly increased from 3.4 mm to a postoperative value of 20.6 mm, p = 0.016. There was no difference in horizontal smile excursion after surgery (35.7 mm vs. 32.2 mm, p = 0.37). Smile angle difference between affected and healthy smile (‚Äö√¢√†‚àö‚â†‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√ú‚Äö√¢√†‚àö‚â†¬¨¬®¬¨¬±) reduced from 27.0¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™ preoperative to 3.5¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö¬™, representing a decrease in facial asymmetry (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Intraoral, externally scarless TTT is an effective option for dynamic facial reanimation, obviating external incisions in select patients.",0,,0,0,0,9,1,2,0,10.1089/fpsam.2021.0028,Facial Plast Surg Aesthet Med. 2022 Mar-Apr;24(2):83-88. doi: 10.1089/fpsam.2021.0028.

Pub-med,Parametric Multi-Scale Modeling of the Zygomaticus Major and Minor: Implications for Facial Reanimation,"Facial paralysis can severely impact functionality and mental health. Facial reanimation surgery can improve facial symmetry and movement. Zygomaticus minor (Zmin) and zygomaticus major (Zmaj) are 2 important perioral muscles, that function to elevate the upper lip, contributing to the formation of a smile. The objective of this study was to analyze the morphology in three-dimensional (3D) and quantify architectural parameters of Zmin and Zmaj. In ten formalin-embalmed specimens, Zmin and Zmaj were serially dissected and digitized at the fiber bundle level. The 2 muscles were modeled in 3D to construct high fidelity models. The 3D models were used to assess muscle morphology and quantify architectural parameters including mean fiber bundle length, physiological cross-sectional area, and line of action. Zygomaticus minor fiber bundles were oriented horizontally or slightly obliquely and had a muscular attachment to the medial modiolus. Zygomaticus minor was found to either have no partitions or medial and lateral partitions. Specimens with partitions were divided into type 1 and type 2. Type 1 consisted of a medial partition with fiber bundles attaching to the zygomatic bone at the inferior margin of the orbit. The type 2 medial partition attached to the lateral margin of the orbit to attach to the zygomatic bone. Zygomaticus major had obliquely oriented fiber bundles with most specimens having inferior and superior partitions attaching to the inferior aspect of the zygomatic bone. Zygomaticus major was found to have a greater mean fiber bundle length and physiological cross-sectional area than Zmin. The direction of the line of action of Zmin and Zmaj was closely related to fiber bundle arrangement. Detailed 3D anatomical understanding of Zmin and Zmaj, at the fiber bundle level, is critical for reconstructive surgeons performing dynamic facial reanimation. This data can be used to assist with selecting the ideal donor site for reconstruction.",0,,2,0,0,0,7,2,0,10.1097/SCS.0000000000008128,J Craniofac Surg. 2022 Mar-Apr 01;33(2):701-706. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000008128.,"Peer M, Tran J, Li Z, Fattah AY, Agur AMR, Davies JC.",2022,34690311,Tools: 3D modeling system,10,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,"['Zmin and zmaj flap', 'Alt flap']",Zmin and zmaj flap,Alt flap,
Pub-med,Masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension: Evaluation and validation of facial symmetry in patients with different levels of asymmetry,"One-stage combined dynamic reanimation with static suspension has obvious advantages of improving facial symmetry. In clinical observation, patients with different levels of oral commissure drooping achieve different symmetry outcomes, despite undergoing the same surgical procedure. Patients with slight asymmetry obtain better outcomes than those with severe asymmetry. The mechanisms influencing postoperative outcomes have not been systematically explored. We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients performed with masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension. Patients were divided into two groups according to the level of oral commissure drooping: slight-asymmetry group (n = 24) and severe-asymmetry group (n = 20). Static and dynamic symmetry were assessed with FACE-gram software pre and postoperatively. The symmetry of the oral commissures at rest and during smiling significantly improved postoperatively in all patients. The differences of the bilateral oral commissure positions were significantly smaller in slight-asymmetry group than that in severe-asymmetry group (p<0.001), indicating that slight-asymmetry group achieved better symmetry. Furthermore, these differences were caused by the oral commissures position on the unaffected side, both pre and postoperatively (p<0.001), but not the paralyzed side's (p>0.05). In conclusion, masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension achieved dynamic and static symmetry in patients with different levels of asymmetry. Patients with slight asymmetry obtained better postoperative symmetry than those with severe asymmetry. Postoperative facial asymmetry might be influenced by the hypertonicity of facial muscles on the unaffected side.",2,,0,2,0,9,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2022.02.011,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2022 Feb 20:S1748-6815(22)00082-1. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2022.02.011.

Pub-med,"Staged upper and lower lip reanimation following facial palsy: Peer-reviewed, patient-rated and objective outcomes","Background: One approach to reanimating both upper and lower lips following facial palsy is through staged surgery: cross-face nerve grafting at stage I, free gracilis muscle transfer to levators at stage II and pedicled anterior belly of digastric muscle transfer (ABDMT) to depressors at stage III. The results of this approach were hitherto unquantified. Methods: This study retrospectively assessed peer-reviewed, patient-rated and objective outcomes following staged reanimation in adults between 2010 and 2020. Demographics, palsy characteristics and surgery details were recorded. Pre- and postoperative videos were rated by independent assessors using Terzis' aesthetic and symmetry scale. Photographs were analysed using Emotrics and patients completed the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) patient-rated outcome measure. Results: Ten patients [mean age = 34 (SD = 12.48)] were eligible. All regained lip elevation and depression. All markers of symmetry improved after gracilis transfer. All markers were also improved after ABDMT except for lower lip height when smiling with teeth showing (p > 0.05). Five patients (50%) responded to the GBI (mean score = +39.44). No patients reported detriment from the reanimations. Mean Terzis' scores preoperatively and after stages II and III were 1.5, 2.26 and 2.39, respectively (p < 0.05). Nine patients underwent aesthetic refinements [lipofilling to lower lip notches (n = 5), debulking of gracilis bulk (n = 6), repositioning of muscle insertion (n = 5) and facelifts (n = 2)]. Conclusion: The outcomes were positive objectively and as judged by peers and patients themselves. Aesthetic refinements may also be required to enhance these results.",0,,1,0,9,9,8,3,0,10.1016/j.bjps.2022.02.078,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2022 Mar 10:S1748-6815(22)00157-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2022.02.078.

Pub-med,Supercharging the Smile: A Novel Dual Nerve Transfer for Facial Reanimation,"Facial paralysis has profound effects on the functional and psychosocial well-being of patients. Various surgical facial reanimation techniques have been described to address this devastating condition. While traditional surgical approaches have proved successful in restoring either facial tone or facial movement, newer combination nerve transfer techniques are addressing the limitations of the traditional single nerve transfer approaches. Methods: This study aimed to describe a promising new surgical approach to facial reanimation utilizing a dual nerve transfer to maximize both resting and active symmetry while minimizing postoperative synkinesis. Here, we use the masseteric nerve to selectively innervate the miDFace in combination with a hypoglossal facial nerve graft to reanimate the remaining facial regions. Results: To date, we have performed this operation on four patients, all of whom tolerated the procedure well. Our patients are showing significant improvements in both resting facial tone and facial movement with no signs of synkinesis at 9 months postoperative. Conclusions: We believe this dual nerve transfer to be superior in restoring the combination of tone, symmetry, and movement to the paralyzed face when compared with traditional single nerve transfer approaches.",6,Masseteric + HFNG,0,0,0,9,2,1,0,10.1097/GOX.0000000000004124,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open. 2022 Feb 17;10(2):e4124. doi: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004124. eCollection 2022 Feb.,"Kuta V, Taylor SM.",2022,35198351,comparing masseteric vs hypoglossal nerve transfer,4,9,,comparing masseteric vs hypoglossal nerve transfer,comparing masseteric vs hypoglossal nerve transfer,Double innervation,,,,,,
