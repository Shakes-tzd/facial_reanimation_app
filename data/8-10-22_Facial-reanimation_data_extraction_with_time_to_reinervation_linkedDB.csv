1908974,Pub-med,Hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional-jump graft for facial reanimation without tongue atrophy,"The hemitongue paralysis that occurs as a result of a classic hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover procedure can result in profound functional deficits in speech, mastication, and swallowing. The procedure is not an option in patients with bilateral facial paralysis or those at risk for combined cranial nerve deficits. To address some of the drawbacks and limitations of this classic procedure, we developed the hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional jump graft (12-7 jump graft) procedure. This procedure involves interposing a nerve graft between a partially severed but functionally intact twelfth cranial nerve and the degenerated seventh cranial nerve, and is often combined with other reanimation procedures. To date, we have performed 33 12-7 jump graft procedures in 30 patients (three were treated for bilateral facial paralysis); this report describes the procedure and its indications, and details the results of 23 procedures performed in 20 patients for whom 24-month follow-up data are available. Twelfth nerve deficits occurred in only three patients in this report. Recovery of facial function began between 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Facial tone and symmetry were achieved in every patient, no patient had significant mass movement, and 13 patients (two of whom were treated for bilateral facial paralysis) had excellent and three had superb restoration of facial movement. These results show the 12-7 jump graft to be a valuable adjunct for facial reanimation in selected patients.",3,,0,2,2,0,2,1,0,23,3,24,41,6,75,24,,,,"Tools: Classification system (not specified) Outcomes:CN 12 deficits, tongue atrophy, difficulty swallowing, mastication, and speech",,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

These techniques involve the use of nerve grafting or crossover procedures combined with a dynamic muscle transfer. A group of 37 patients who underwent five different combinations of reanimation was analyzed. The techniques were evaluated using a standard rating scheme for judging success of reanimation procedures. The combination of a masseter muscle transfer to the lower region of the face and a cable graft of the upper facial nerve division appeared to offer excellent results in terms of independent motion of the upper and lower regions of the face and good eye closure, while allowing spontaneous mimetic function in 50% of cases. The advantages and disadvantages of the other techniques are described.

The majority of patients were treated in two stages with cross-facial nerve graft as the first stage and microvascular muscle transfer at the second stage. The gracilis muscle was used in 62 patients. A system of grading results has been utilized in the long-term evaluation. The overall final result was excellent or good in 51 percent of 47 patients who were available for follow-up. Although the results are not completely satisfactory, they justify the use of this approach to a difficult clinical problem. The results are improving as technical modifications to the procedure have evolved. The gracilis muscle is a reliable free transfer with internal anatomy conductive to use for reanimation of the paralyzed face. This type of transfer, in our experience, has proved superior to nonmicrosurgical methods for treatment of complete and severe incomplete facial palsy. The seventh cranial nerve is used in the innervation of the transferred muscle, the ipsilateral being preferable if available. The authors believe that use of the same cranial nerve is superior to methods that involve other cranial nerves, where spontaneity is often not achieved.",1,,0,0,9,9,8,1,0,69,6,9,33,6,65,24,,,,"neg: hematoma, vascular complications",,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,,,
3083357,Pub-med,Preliminary observations after facial rehabilitation with the ansa hypoglossi pedicle transfer,"Facial paralysis is a very disabling condition, both functionally and cosmetically. Despite the different methods of facial reanimation that have been described, there is no single method that will restore normal facial tone and motion. Of the methods available, primary neurorrhaphy is probably the most effective. The recovery period, however, is prolonged and, as a result, muscle tone and bulk may be lost. The hypoglossal-facial anastomosis is also a very reliable and effective technique but requires necessary interruption of both major cranial nerve trunks. Transfer of a neuromuscular pedicle (based on the ansa hypoglossi) has been offered as a method of facial reanimation that involves neither prolonged recovery nor interruption of the major cranial nerve functions. The application of this technique for reinnervation of a paralyzed larynx was first described by Tucker in 1970, and the technique was applied to facial muscle (in animal models) in 1977. The effectiveness of this technique--and its application in the management of facial paralysis in the human patient--remains controversial. We report our experience with a series of six patients who underwent neuromuscular pedicle transfer in conjunction with other more conventional methods of facial reanimation. The function of the pedicle and its contribution to the overall facial rehabilitation were assessed clinically and electromyographically. Factors influencing the success of the procedure and clinical and experimental evidence to support its application are discussed. While our experience with this technique is limited, it would appear that the neuromuscular pedicle transfer may play a useful adjunctive role in reanimation of the face in selective cases of facial paralysis.",3,,0,0,0,9,8,3,0,6,5.15,,33,6,65,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,"Tools: EMG, clinical evaluation Outcomes: evidence of reinnervation, facial movements",,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

7719600,Pub-med,Irreversible muscle contracture after functioning free muscle transplantation using the ipsilateral facial nerve for reinnervation,"Four patients who underwent functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) for facial reconstruction developed a progressive disfiguring muscle contracture. This complication has not been previously reported. Three of the patients had longstanding facial paralysis and were reanimated by FFMT. The fourth patient had left hemifacial atrophy but without facial paralysis. She also underwent FFMT for augmentation. All four FFMTs were innervated by the ipsilateral facial nerve. Initially, they all had a normal facial appearance at rest during the first few months after FFMT. However, they all developed a progressive severe muscle contracture from 6 to 12 months after FFMT. Continuous spontaneous electrical impulse activity, which stimulated the transferred muscle day and night, may be responsible for the progressive muscle contracture. From the patients' reported sensations and from clinical evaluation, which included a local xylocaine injection test, over-reinnervation with a synkinesis effect of the transferred muscle is hypothetically the main cause, not over-tension of the muscle itself. This complication may possibly be avoided by limiting or decreasing the number of fascicles from the ipsilateral facial nerve or better by using a cross-facial nerve graft instead of the ipsilateral facial nerve as the innervating motor nerve. The outcome with a cross-facial nerve is likely to be more predictable and reliable.",1,,0,0,1,7,4,1,0,4,5.25,8,20.25,15,26,,,,,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

All patients previously had undergone resection of a large acoustic neurinoma and the facial nerve had been resected at that time. The interval between tumor reaction and hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis ranged from 1 to 6 months, with an average of 2.1 months. Postoperative recovery of facial movement was good in all cases during an average follow-up period of 4.2 years. In all eight patients, the degree of hypoglossal nerve atrophy on the operated side was graded mild or moderate, but not severe.

Using this technique, the mastoid process is partially resected to open the stylomastoid foramen and the descending portion of the facial nerve in the mastoid cavity is exposed by drilling to the level of the external genu and then sectioning its most proximal portion. The hypoglossal nerve beneath the internal jugular vein is exposed at the level of the axis and dissected as proximally as possible. One-half of the hypoglossal nerve is transected: use of less than one-half of the hypoglossal nerve is adequate for approximation to the distal stump of the atrophic facial nerve. The nerve endings, the proximally cut end of the hypoglossal nerve, and the distal stump of the facial nerve are approximated and anastomosed without tension. This technique was used in four patients with long-standing facial paralysis (greater than 24 months), and it provided satisfactory facial reanimation, with no evidence of hemitongue atrophy or dysfunction. Because it completely preserves glossal function, the hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis described here constitutes a successful approach in patients with long-standing facial paralysis who do not wish to have tongue function compromised.",3,,0,0,0,7,4,1,0,4,8,12,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,anastomosis",,May's grading system,,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

Although the results are promising, the two operations, about 1 year apart, exert an economic burden on the patients and require a lengthy period before obtaining results. Sequelae such as hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and conspicuous scar on the donor leg for harvesting a sural nerve graft also cannot be disregarded. To overcome such drawbacks of the two-stage method, we report a refined technique utilizing one-stage microvascular free transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle. Its thoracodorsal nerve is crossed through the upper lip and sutured to the contralateral intact facial nerve branches. Reinnervation of the transferred muscle is established at a mean of 7 months postoperatively, which is faster than that of the two-stage method.

While this procedure has proven its reliability, its problems with hemilingual atrophy (speech deglutition, drooling, mastication), hypertonia, synkinesis, and mimetic deficits indicate the need for a more perfect solution for facial paralysis. The jump interpositional graft hypoglossal facial anastomosis (JIGHFA) along with gold weight lid implantation and electromyographic (EMG) rehabilitation achieves substantial facial reanimation without hemilingual deficits. We present our results in 18 patients who underwent JIGHFA along with gold weight lid implantation and EMG rehabilitation for facial paralysis. These results were compared with those from published series of 30 patients treated with HFA with EMG rehabilitation evaluated with objective (House-Brackmann) criteria. Anonymous retrospective information from questionnaires from 22 of 48 patients who were treated with the classic HFA was also presented. In properly selected patients, the JIGHFA technique is capable of achieving substantial facial reinnervation (House-Brackmann grade III or better) in 83.3% of the patients without hemilingual sequelae which was seen in 45% of the HFA patients. In contrast to the HFA, this procedure can be used by patients with concomitant lower cranial nerve paralysis (except hypoglossal), and bilateral facial paralysis. Hypertonia, synkinesis, and lagophthalmus were less symptomatic in the JIGHFA patients.

The ten patients having traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomoses showed different degrees of tongue disability and retention of residue in the oral cavity. Surgical recovery of postoperative facial palsy can be obtained with various techniques according to the availability of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem.

Patients with a neoplastic etiology of nerve paralysis tended to have a worse outcome. Conclusions: Facial nerve grafting is most successful if intervention is undertaken at or near the time of initial injury. However, prolonged time (up to two years) to repair does not preclude the potential for some recovery.

Although the results of reconstruction with this method are satisfactory, there is an excessive delay between stages, which prolongs the period of rehabilitation. In 1995, Kumar overcame this and presented his preliminary results from a single-stage transfer of the gracilis. We compared the long-term results of the single-stage with the two-stage method of reconstruction. Patients selected the method of reconstruction on the basis of the information, photographs of scars, and video recording of results given to them at a special facial palsy clinic. Ten patients selected the single-stage reconstruction and 15 selected the two-stage reconstruction. The mean follow-up period was 3 years.

16641724,Embase,One-stage reanimation of the paralyzed face using the rectus abdominis neurovascular free flap,"BACKGROUND: Functional free muscle transfer for the surgical correction of long-standing facial paralysis has gained validity over the past three decades. These traditionally multistep reconstructions often achieve clinical success, but at the cost of significant morbidity and lengthy recovery periods. To address this dilemma, the authors propose reconstruction using the rectus abdominis and accompanying intercostal nerve in a one-stage neurovascular free flap reanimation procedure. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, five patients with long-standing unilateral facial paralysis at the University of Pittsburgh Facial Nerve Center underwent reanimation using the authors' protocol. Preoperative and postoperative assessments included clinical evaluation using the Facial Grading System and electromyography. The patients were followed for a mean of 16 months. RESULTS: At the final postoperative visit, all five patients demonstrated improved levator electromyographic potential, with a median 67 percent improvement. All five patients further demonstrated an increase in zygomaticus electromyographic potential, with a median 225 percent improvement. All five patients demonstrated increased Facial Grading System score at most recent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The one-step reanimation using free rectus abdominis neurovascular free flap demonstrated a consistent positive outcome in electromyographic and clinical assessments. The additional benefits of reduced recovery time and anatomical reliability of the flap render the authors' method preferable to other traditional methods of surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face.

Patients: Ten patients with facial paralysis from proximal nerve injury underwent the facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with a parotid-release maneuver. Main outcome measures: The Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and photographs. Results: Facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with parotid release was technically feasible in all cases, and anastomosis was performed distal to the origin of the ansa hypoglossi. All patients had good return of facial nerve function. Nine patients had scores of C or better, indicating strong eyelid and oral sphincter closure and mass motion. There was no hemilingual atrophy and no subjective tongue dysfunction. Conclusions: The parotid-release maneuver mobilizes additional length to the facial nerve, facilitating a tensionless communication distal to the ansa hypoglossi. The technique is a viable option for facial reanimation, and our patients achieved good clinical outcomes with continual improvement.",3,,0,0,2,1,9,1,0,10,8,,,13,58,11,48,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,,"The Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaire,facial stiffness and eye dryness",,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

We used it on five patients who had facial palsy after excision of malignant parotid tumours. The wide skin defect that exposed the masseter muscle after total parotidectomy was reconstructed with a free flap. This method differs from those of other methods of transposing the masseter muscle in that force is applied at an upper lateral angle. Our method provided dynamic raising of the upper lip, the corner of the mouth, and the nasolabial fold in four patients.

18470830,Pub-med,Free tissue transfer for the treatment of facial paralysis,"Long-standing facial paralysis requires the introduction of viable, innervated dynamic muscle to restore facial movement. The options include regional muscle transfer and microvascular free tissue transfer. There are advantages and disadvantages of each. Briefly, the regional muscle transfer procedures are reliable and provide immediate return of movement. However, the movement is not of a spontaneous mimetic nature. Free tissue transfer, in contrast, offers the possibility of synchronous, mimetic movement. It does, however, require a prolonged healing time in comparison with that of regional muscle transfer. The choice is made by physician and patient together, taking into account their preferences and biases. Muscle-alone free tissue transfer is our preferred option for reanimation of uncomplicated facial paralysis without skin or soft tissue deficits. Combined muscle and other tissue (most are skin flap) is another preferred option for more challenging complex facial paralysis with skin or soft tissue deficits after tumor excision. Gracilis flap is the author's first choice of muscle transplantation for both reconstructions. From 1986 to 2006, gracilis functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) was performed at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital for facial reanimation in 249 cases of facial paralysis. The main etiology is postoperative complication and Bell's palsy. The innervating nerve comes mostly from contralateral facial nerve branches, few from ipsilateral facial nerve due to tumor ablation, and from ipsilateral motor branch to masseter or spinal accessory nerve due to M‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚àûbius syndrome.

18842469,Embase,Masseteric-facial nerve coaptation - an alternative technique for facial nerve reinnervation,"Background: Reinnervation of the facial musculature when there is loss of the proximal facial nerve poses a difficult clinical problem. Restoration of spontaneous mimetic motion is the aim and, to this end, the use of cross-facial nerve grafts has long been considered the reconstruction of choice. The nerve to masseter has been used very successfully for reinnervation of microvascular functioning muscle transfers for facial reanimation in established facial palsy but its use as a direct nerve transfer to the facial nerve to reinnervate 'viable' facial musculature has been scarce. Methods: Electron micrographic studies of axonal counts in the nerve to masseter and nerve to gracilis in a clinical series of seven patients undergoing surgery for facial nerve palsy were made. Based on these results, and previous success with the use of the nerve to masseter for reinnervation of free gracilis transfers, we report our experience with the transfer of the nerve to masseter for direct coaptation with the ipsilateral facial nerve to restore facial motion. Results: Our axonal counts of the nerve to masseter have, on average, 1542 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 291.70 (SD) axons. Historical data have shown that the buccal branch of the facial nerve has 834 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 285 (SD) where the distal end of a cross-facial nerve graft has 100 to 200 axons. Our clinical use of the nerve to masseter as a direct nerve transfer in three patients based on these data has resulted in significant improvement in facial symmetry in repose (at a minimum of 1 year follow up), restoration of facial motion with occasional spontaneous activity and minimal synkinesis without any donor morbidity. Conclusions: The advantages of this technique include the ease of dissection, constant and reliable anatomy, powerful reinnervation of the facial muscles without donor site morbidity and the potential for return of spontaneous facial movement.

19050488,Embase,Uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial paralysis,"BACKGROUND: The superficial temporal fascia merits its popularity in reconstructive surgery for its large number of clinical applications. In this report, the authors present their experience with different uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial reanimation. METHODS: Seventeen cases are presented. In 10 patients, the fascial flap provided a vascularized lining at the interface between the free muscle flap for smile restoration and the overlying skin. In six cases, it was utilized to correct small or moderate contour deficits in the paretic hemiface, using either the fascial flap alone or in combination with free adipose tissue. One patient presented with facial paralysis and Frey syndrome following parotidectomy, and the fascial flap was used to control gustatory sweating. Five independent observers graded aesthetic and functional outcomes on a scale from poor to excellent. Three patients were lost to follow-up, so 14 cases were evaluated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months (47 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 60.49 months). The specific reconstructive goal for each patient was achieved and the overall symmetry was greatly improved, with all patients being granted higher scores by the panel of observers following the superficial fascia flap (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks, p < 0.0001). Transient or permanent alopecia along the temporal incision was the main complication observed. CONCLUSIONS: Transfer of the superficial temporal fascia flap is a valuable technique with several potential applications in facial paralysis management and reconstructive surgery in general. The advantages of this highly vascularized, gliding, and pliable flap far outweigh the associated minimal complications. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2008 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,0,10,9,2,1,0,16.99,6,,18.6,3,46,1,216,,,"neg: Transient or permanent alopecia along the temporal incision

This article presents the results achieved by free functional muscle transplantation for reconstruction of the paralyzed face, registered by three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements. Methods: Of patients treated consecutively between 1997 and 2006, two groups were constituted: group 1 comprised 22 patients with reinnervation completed after a single cross-face nerve graft and a free gracilis muscle graft for reconstruction of the smile; group 2 comprised nine patients treated with two cross-face nerve grafts followed by a territorially differentiated gracilis muscle transplant for reconstruction of the smile and eye closure. Smiling with showing teeth, maximal showing of teeth, and closing the eyes as in sleep were analyzed in detail. Results: In group 1, static asymmetry was reduced from 12.19 +/- 8.73 mm preoperatively to -1.84 +/- 7.67 mm at 18 months postoperatively. Smile amplitude increased from 9 to 60 percent of that on the healthy side in 10 incomplete facial palsies of this group, and from 0 to 62 percent in eight functionally successful muscle grafts among 11 patients with complete lesions. In group 2, static asymmetry improved from 7.24 +/- 12.64 mm to -5.36 +/- 9.07 mm; the overcorrection was intentional. Movement was improved in eight cases. Smile amplitude reached 68 +/- 43 percent of that on the normal side. Lagophthalmus improved from 7.21 +/- 3.59 mm to 1.38 +/- 2.49 mm. All improvements were statistically significant (p <or= 0.05). Conclusions: Three-dimensional video analysis provided an exact quantitative documentation of the degree of facial palsy preoperatively and the reconstructed movements.

This problem is frequently addressed by performing staged gracilis transplants without specific oral sphincter reconstruction. The purpose of this study is to describe the technique of bilateral simultaneous free gracilis muscle transfer with oral sphincter reconstruction, for one-stage facial reanimation in patients with bilateral facial paralysis. Study design: Case series. Methods/results: One-stage bilateral gracilis transfer was performed in three patients with bilateral facial paralysis. Muscle transplants produced a meaningful smile in all transferred muscles. All patients reported improved speech and decreased drooling. Conclusions: Bilateral gracilis transplants with reconstruction of the oral commissure is a realistic option in management of the bilaterally paralyzed face. In this small series, it appears to improve oral competence, restore smiling, and contribute favorably to lower lip support. This technique has been made more feasible because the operative time for free tissue transfer has continuously declined with the use of two-team surgery, improved microsurgical techniques, and the advent of venous coupling devices.",0,,1,0,0,9,4,1,0,3,2,6,25.67,10,39,3,24,,,"Tools: clinical evaluation Outcomes: smile, oral competence, lower lip support",,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,,,
19568051,Embase,Single-stage facial reanimation in the surgical treatment of unilateral established facial paralysis,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of unilateral long-standing facial paralysis requires transposition of new musculature to restore the function of the atrophied mimetic musculature. Facial reanimation with free neuromuscular flaps is actually the accepted standard treatment. Two-stage procedures have been used for years, with a total flap recovery time of 18 to 24 months. In 1998, Harii proposed single-stage facial reanimation using the latissimus dorsi flap, showing a faster recovery compared with two-stage procedures. The present study evaluated the results of the authors' center applying the single-stage facial reanimation. METHODS: From April of 1999 to April of 2006, 33 patients with unilateral established facial paralysis underwent single-stage facial reanimation via latissimus dorsi free flap transplantation. Time from the onset of paralysis ranged from 20 months to 64 years (mean, 11.6 years). Patients were followed postoperatively for at least 24 months. Results were studied and compared using Terzis and Noah's 1997 classification. RESULTS: Among the 33 patients included in the study, there was an average reinnervation time of 8.9 months. According to Terzis and Noah's classification system, 12 patients (36.3 percent) were considered grade V, 12 (36.3 percent) were grade IV, four (12.2 percent) were grade III, two (6.1 percent) were grade II, and three (9.1 percent) were grade I. CONCLUSIONS: Single-stage facial reanimation with a latissimus dorsi flap achieved morphofunctional results similar to those obtained with the classic two-stage technique. In addition, the authors were able to reduce the morbidity associated with treatment and the time required for recovery. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2009 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",0,,2,0,9,9,2,1,0,33,1.67,22,47.8,5,73,24,,,,"neg: no HB improvement, synkinesis, pseudospasm, infection, flap loss",,,,no nerve transfer,,,['Latissimus dorsi flap'],Latissimus dorsi flap,,,,

They were divided into 2 nonrandomized groups according to insertion technique: group I (9 patients), interrupted suture between the free flap and the orbicularis oris of the upper and lower lip on the paralyzed side; group II (22 patients), palmaris longus tendon graft placed between the gracilis free flap and the orbicularis oris of the upper and lower lip on the nonparalyzed side. Qualitative evaluation of the smile demonstrated better results in patients from group II. Comparing the position of the Cupid's bow at rest, pre- and postoperatively in each patient, we observed significant improvement of facial symmetry in both groups. During smile, however, there was a significantly higher rate of centralization of the Cupid's bow in patients submitted to reanimation with the use of the palmaris longus tendon (group II). ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",0,,2,0,10,9,8,3,0,31,3,6.03,33.4,7,58,12,36,,,"neg: fluid collection requiring takeback

19944241,Embase,Facial animation in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes,"Background: Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of varying severity, involves multiple cranial nerves and is characterized predominantly by bilateral or unilateral paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves. The paralysis of the VI and VII cranial nerves leads to a lack of function in the muscles they supply. Facial paralysis often causes bilabial incompetence with speech difficulties, oral incompetence, problems with eating and drinking, including pocketing of food in the cheek and dribbling, as well as severe drooling. Methods: In this study, we report on pediatric patients with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes seen and treated surgically from 2003 to September 2007 at the Operative Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery, Head and Neck Department, University of Parma, Italy. Results: Twelve patients underwent microsurgical reconstruction for restoration of facial movement. The contralateral facial nerve was used as a motor donor nerve in 4 procedures, the motor nerve to the masseter muscle was used in 8 patients, and the gracilis muscle was used in all operations, with a total of 17 free-muscle transplantations. All free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. We observed a significant improvement in drooling, drinking, speech, and facial animation with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Conclusions: The gracilis muscle free transfer is a surgical procedure well tolerated by the young patients and well accepted by their families. We consider it a safe and reliable technique for facial reanimation with good aesthetical and functional results in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

20417006,Embase,Facial Animation With Free-Muscle Transfer Innervated by the Masseter Motor Nerve in Unilateral Facial Paralysis,"Purpose: Facial paralysis is a congenital or acquired disorder of varying severity leading to an asymmetric or absent facial expression. It represents an important debilitation from both esthetic and functional points of view. In this article we report our experience with patients treated with gracilis muscle transplantation innervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. We discuss the surgical technique and the functional and esthetic results and evaluate the effectiveness of this donor nerve in providing adequate innervation to the muscle transfer for lower facial reanimation. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with unilateral facial paralysis were seen and surgically treated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy, between 2003 and 2007. In this study we report on 8 cases treated with gracilis muscle transfer reinnervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. Results: In this series all free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. Facial symmetry at rest and while smiling was excellent or good in all patients, and we observed a significant improvement in speech and oral competence. With practice, the majority of patients developed the ability to smile spontaneously and without jaw movement. Conclusions: We consider the masseter motor nerve a powerful and reliable donor nerve, allowing us to obtain a commissure and upper lip movement similar to those of the normal site for amount and direction. This is why we think that there may be a larger role for the masseter motor nerve for innervation of patients with unilateral facial paralysis who would otherwise have been considered candidates for cross-facial nerve graft innervation of the muscle transfer. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",2,,1,3,0,9,4,1,0,15,3.5,,20.5,7,60,12,,,,,,,,Masseteric nerve transfer,,,,,,,,
20595863,Pub-med,Blink restoration in adult facial paralysis,"Background: Impaired eyelid function in facial paralysis patients is a serious disability that can even threaten vision. Eye reanimation techniques and specifically blink restoration reinstates the cornea's protective mechanism and recovers a more natural appearance and eye function. Both dynamic and static procedures have been used to augment eye closure, but only dynamic procedures can lead to blink restoration. In this study, the experience of a single surgeon (J.K.T.) with dynamic procedures addressing the challenge of blink restoration is presented. Methods: A retrospective review of 95 adult patients who underwent dynamic procedures for blink restoration was performed. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 75) included patients who underwent nerve transfers, including cross-facial nerve grafting and subsequent microcoaptations, mini-hypoglossal nerve transfers, and direct orbicularis oculi muscle neurotization. Group B (n = 20) included patients who underwent eye sphincter substitution procedures, including pedicled frontalis or mini-temporalis transfers, free platysma, occipitalis, gracilis subunits, extensor digitorum brevis, and a slip of adductor longus transfer. Objective blink ratios were measured according to a protocol established by the senior author (J.K.T.). Results: The patients included 34 men and 61 women. Mean age was 34.9 +/- 9.8 years. Denervation time ranged from 7 months to 42.12 years, and the mean denervation time was 13.02 years. Blink improvement was noted in all of the patients.

Methods: Disrupted buccal branches provided a recipient facial nerve for 24 gracilis reinnervations. An additional 15 free flaps were used for extensive composite defects. Smile outcome was graded according to Terzis' criteria after 2 years of recurrence-free follow-up. The effects of postoperative radiotherapy, integrity of the oral commissure, and double free flaps were compared. Results: Eighteen patients completed 2 years' recurrence-free follow-up; average smile outcome was Terzis grade 4 (mean, 3.8).

Two patient groups were measured: seven patients were waiting for surgery, the other seven patients had already been submitted to surgery, and had regained facial mimicry. Each patient performed three facial animations: brow raise; free smile; lip purse. These were recorded using an optoelectronic motion analyser. The three-dimensional coordinates of facial landmarks were obtained, their movements were computed, and asymmetry indices calculated (differential movements between the two hemi-faces: healthy and paretic/rehabilitated). Before surgery, mobility was larger in the healthy than in the paretic side; after surgery, the differences were reduced (brow raise and lip purse), or even reversed (smile). Before surgery, lip purse was performed with significant labial asymmetry (p=0.042; larger healthy side movement). After surgery, asymmetry indices reduced. Total labial asymmetry during smiling was significantly different from 0 before surgery (p=0.018, larger healthy side movement). After surgery, all asymmetry indices became non-significant.

The detached fibers were then sutured to a fascia lata graft, which was passed and secured to the orbicularis oris to reanimate the corner of the mouth. The procedure is less extensive and provides a direct ""orthodromic"" line of pull with good muscular excursion and power. This simple procedure has been applied to 12 consecutive cases with long-standing complete facial paralysis presenting to the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Clinic at the Ain-Shams University Hospital over the past 2 years.

22310454,Pub-med,Recovery of emotional smiling function in free-flap facial reanimation,"Purpose: Long-standing unilateral facial palsy is treated primarily with free-flap surgery using the masseteric or contralateral facial nerve as a motor source. The use of a gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve restores the smiling function, without obtaining spontaneity. Because emotional smiling is an important factor in facial reanimation, the facial nerve must serve as the motor source to achieve this fundamental target. Materials and methods: From October 1998 to October 2009, 50 patients affected by long-standing unilateral facial paralysis underwent single-stage free-flap reanimation procedures to recover smiling function. A latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve was transplanted in 40 patients, and a gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve in 10 patients. All patients underwent a clinical examination that analyzed voluntary and spontaneous smiling. Results: All patients who received a latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve and recovered muscle function (92.5%) showed voluntary and spontaneous smiling abilities. All patients who received a gracilis free flap innervated by the masseteric nerve recovered function, but only 1 (10%) showed occasional spontaneous flap activation. During those rare activations, much less movement was visible on the operated side than when the patient was asked to smile voluntarily. Conclusions: The masseteric nerve is a powerful motor source that guarantees free voluntary gracilis muscle activation; however, it does not guarantee any spontaneous smiling. Single-stage procedures that use a latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve have a lower success rate and obtain less movement; however, spontaneous smiling is always observed.",2,,1,0,0,2,8,1,0,40,3,,16.4,7,45,,,,,"Terzis, clinical evaluation.

22431814,Pub-med,Simultaneous anterolateral thigh flap and temporalis tendon transfer to optimize facial form and function after radical parotidectomy,"Background Extirpation of aggressive parotid or cutaneous facial tumors often involves facial nerve sacrifice and the creation of a large soft-tissue defect. We describe a method for single-stage reconstruction during radical parotidectomy to restore facial form and function without additional morbidity. Methods We conducted a review of immediate reconstruction/reanimation of radical parotidectomy defects with the use of anterolateral thigh (ALT) fat and fascia flaps for facial contouring, orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer (OTTT), cable grafting of the facial nerve, and fascia lata lower lip suspension. Results Five patients (mean age, 67.4 years) underwent extirpation of malignant tumors with facial nerve sacrifice resulting in large soft-tissue deficits. All patients had ALT free tissue transfer to correct facial contour defects and OTTT to restore facial form and function. Four patients underwent cable grafting of facial nerve branches. Branches of the motor nerve to the vastus lateralis harvested from the ALT surgical site were used for cable nerve grafting in 3 patients. Fascia lata from the same ALT harvest site was used for lower lip suspension to the OTTT in 4 patients. There were no donor site complications. All patients achieved miDFacial symmetry at rest, oral competence with dynamic corner-of-mouth movement, and full eye closure. Conclusions Tumor clearance, symmetric facial appearance, as well as dynamic facial rehabilitation were accomplished in a single-stage procedure using the method described herein. The ALT free flap provides versatile options for soft-tissue defects as well as access to motor nerves optimal for grafting without additional morbidity.

22451794,Pub-med,Outcomes of Direct Facial-to-Hypoglossal Neurorrhaphy with Parotid Release,"Lesions of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle and their management can result in facial nerve paralysis. When the nerve deficit is not amenable to primary end-to-end repair or interpositional grafting, nerve transposition can be used to accomplish the goals of restoring facial tone, symmetry, and voluntary movement. The most widely used nerve transposition is the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastamosis, of which there are several technical variations. Previously we described a technique of single end-to-side anastamosis using intratemporal facial nerve mobilization and parotid release. This study further characterizes the results of this technique with a larger patient cohort and longer-term follow-up. The design of this study is a retrospective chart review and the setting is an academic tertiary care referral center. Twenty-one patients with facial nerve paralysis from proximal nerve injury at the cerebellopontine angle underwent facial-hypoglossal neurorraphy with parotid release. Outcomes were assessed using the Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and patient photographs. Of the 21 patients, 18 were successfully reinnervated to a score of a B or C on the recovery scale, which equates to good oral and ocular sphincter closure with minimal mass movement. The mean duration of paralysis between injury and repair was 12.1 months (range 0 to 36 months) with a mean follow-up of 55 months. There were no cases of hemiglossal atrophy, paralysis, or subjective dysfunction. Direct facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with parotid release achieved a functional reinnervation and good clinical outcome in the majority of patients, with minimal lingual morbidity. This technique is a viable option for facial reanimation and should be strongly considered as a surgical option for the paralyzed face.",3,,0,0,1,9,8,1,0,21,10,,67.4,48,82,,,,,"Tools: clinical evaluation, pt. satisfaction questionnaire, Facial Nerve Recovery Scale Outcomes: first contraction, tongue mobility, degree of atrophy,",,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

Treatment is based on dynamic procedures such as functional muscle flaps. The benefit of added axonal load has recently been reported. This study describes a two stage technique involving dual innervation of a gracilis muscle flap with initial cross-facial nerve graft (CFNG) followed by free muscle transfer co-apted to both the CFNG and a masseter nerve for facial reanimation. Methods: A total of nine patients from August 2008-July 2011 were operated on with the double innervated gracilis muscle flap. Pre- and postoperative electromyography was documented, and video analysis with the five-stage classification of reanimation outcomes was performed. Results: All patients recovered voluntary and spontaneous smile abilities, with an average of 70% motor unit recruitment. Based on the Terzis reanimation outcome classification, four patients had an excellent result, four good, and one moderate.

26026222,Pub-med,Double-powered free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation: A longitudinal optoelectronic study,"The choice of the motor donor nerve is a crucial point in free flap transfer algorithms. In the case of unilateral facial paralysis, the contralateral healthy facial nerve can provide coordinated smile animation and spontaneous emotional expression, but with unpredictable axonal ingrowth into the recipient muscle. Otherwise, the masseteric nerve ipsilateral to the paralysis can provide a powerful neural input, without a spontaneous trigger of the smile. Harvesting a bulky muscular free flap may enhance the quantity of contraction but esthetic results are unpleasant. Therefore, the logical solution for obtaining high amplitude of smiling combined with spontaneity of movement is to couple the neural input: the contralateral facial nerve plus the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Thirteen patients with unilateral dense facial paralysis underwent a one-stage facial reanimation with a gracilis flap powered by a double donor neural input, provided by both the ipsilateral masseteric nerve (coaptation by an end-to-end neurorrhaphy with the obturator nerve) and the contralateral facial nerve (coaptation through a cross-face nerve graft: end-to-end neurorrhaphy on the healthy side and end-to-side neurorrhaphy on the obturator nerve, distal to the masseteric/obturator neurorrhaphy). Their facial movements were evaluated with an optoelectronic motion analyzer. Before surgery, on average, the paretic side exhibited a smaller total three-dimensional mobility than the healthy side, with a 52% activation ratio and >30% of asymmetry. After surgery, the differences significantly decreased (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p < 0.05), with an activation ratio between 75% (maximum smile) and 91% (maximum smile with teeth clenching), and <20% of asymmetry. Similar modifications were seen for the performance of spontaneous smiles. The significant presurgical asymmetry of labial movements reduced after surgery. The use of a double donor neural input permitted both movements that were similar in force to that of the healthy side, and spontaneous movements elicited by emotional triggering.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,0,3,2,8,3,0,13,10,,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:cross-face,masseteric nerve",,tools: clinical and optoelectronic motion analyzer.,,,,Double innervation,,,,,,,,

We describe the trifurcation technique as a modification of the combined approach on example of two patients with locally advanced parotid cancer. Methods: Due to perineural invasion, extensive resection of the FN from the mastoid segment to the peripheral branches was required. For reanimation of the upper face, a complex cervical plexus graft was sutured end-to-end to the mastoid segment of the FN trunk. The branches of the graft enabled reanimation of three peripheral temporal and zygomatic branches. The mandibular branch was sutured end-to-side to the hypoglossal nerve (hypoglossal‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬®facial nerve transfer, HFNT). Additionally, the buccal branch was independently reanimated with ansa cervicalis. Results: Facial reanimation was successful in both patients. Good resting tone and voluntary movement were achieved with a mild degree of synkinesis after 13¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†months. Patient 1 showed the Sunnybrook (SB) composite score 69 [76 (voluntary movement score) ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚â† 0 (resting symmetry score) ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚â† 7 (synkinesis score)].

31688275,Pub-med,Comparative Study of 2 Different Innervation Techniques in Facial Reanimation: Cross-face Nerve Graft-Innervated Versus Double-Innervated Free Gracilis Muscle Transfer,"Recently, 1-stage double innervation with the masseter nerve and the CFNG has gained popularity owing to its outcomes of powerful and synchronous muscle contraction. In this study, we compared CFNG- and double-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT) for facial palsy reconstruction.A total of 49 patients with facial palsy who underwent facial reanimation surgery from August 2013 to January 2017 were enrolled. The CFNG group (18 patients) underwent 2-stage CFNG innervation, whereas the double-innervated FGMT group (31 patients) underwent dual coaptation with end-to-end masseter nerve and end-to-side CFNG. The FACEgram software was used for evaluating smile excursion, symmetry index, spontaneous smile occurrence, Terzis' score including palsy pathogenesis, and clinical progress.In the CFNG group, the smile excursion at rest increased (P = 0.000); however, there was increased smile excursion both at rest and during smiling in the double-innervated FMGT group (rest P = 0.002, smile P = 0.028). Improvement of the symmetry index was observed only in the FMGT group (rest P = 0.001, smile P = 0.000). There was no significant difference in Terzis' scores. The average time to the first visible muscle contracture was statistically significantly shorter in the double-innervated FGMT group (P = 0.035). With respect to spontaneous smile achievement, the double-innervated FGMT group (25.8%) showed a satisfactory outcome.Cross-face nerve graft-innervated FGMT improved only smile excursion at rest, whereas double-innervated FGMT provided improvement in both the resting and smiling postures. Furthermore, the double-innervated FGMT group showed a higher symmetry index.

However, these complex procedures sometimes result in cheek bulkiness owing to the double muscle transfer. We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with long-standing facial paralysis, who underwent two-stage facial reanimation using two superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle innervated by the masseteric and contralateral facial nerves via a sural nerve graft. Each muscle subslip was transferred to the upper lip and oral commissures, which were oriented in different directions. Furthermore, a horizontal fascia lata graft was added at the lower lip to prevent deformities such as lower lip elongation and deviation. Voluntary contraction was noted at roughly 4 months, and a spontaneous smile without biting was noted 8 months postoperatively. At 18 months after surgery, the patient demonstrated a spontaneous symmetrical smile with adequate excursion of the lower lip, upper lip, and oral commissure, without cheek bulkiness. Dual-innervated muscle transfer using two multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle may be a good option for long-standing facial paralysis, as it can achieve a symmetrical smile that can be performed voluntarily and spontaneously.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,2,3,0,9,4,1,0,1,4,,,,,,,"other:serratus anterior muslce, Sural nerve graft",serratus anterior muslce + sural nerve graft,serratus anterior muslce + sural nerve graft,,,,Double innervation,,,"['Serratus anterior muscle flap', 'Fascia flap']",Serratus anterior,Fascia flap,,,
34760845,Pub-med,Two-Stage Dual-Nerve Facial Reanimation: Outcomes and Complications in a Series of Pediatric Patients,"Background: In facial reanimation via microneurovascular muscle transfer, dual-nerve reinnervation of the muscle capitalizes on the synergistic effects of spontaneous motion from cross facial nerve grafting (CFNG) and increased excursion from masseteric nerve transfer. Two-stage approaches that delay masseteric nerve transfer until the time of the muscle flap increase spontaneity by maximizing muscle reinnervation from the CFNG. While this 2-stage, dual-nerve approach has been described in adults, we present a series of pediatric patients who underwent this reconstructive technique. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients who underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction with CFNG and ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfers. Procedures were performed between 2004 and 2016 by 2 surgeons at a single centre. Degree of facial paralysis before and after surgical intervention was measured using House-Brackmann scores. Results: Nine patients with a mean age of 8.6 (range: 5-15 years) years at time of surgery underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction. Average time between CFNG and transfer of the free gracilis with masseteric nerve transfer was 13.3 (SD 2.4) months. Mean follow-up was 27.3 months (SD 25.7). Patients demonstrated initiation of voluntary movement on paralyzed side by 3.6 months (SD 0.6) on average, with 3 patients demonstrating spontaneous movement at 3 months. Conclusion: The 2-stage, dual innervation technique using CFNG and delayed ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfer with a free gracilis is a promising reconstructive option to maximize spontaneous expression in pediatric patients.

Reanimation of the cheek and the angle of the mouth,"For reanimation of the cheek in 8 young patients with long-standing facial palsy a method with cross-face nerve grafting followed by free muscle transplantation has been used. The sural nerve was used as nerve graft and placed in a subcutaneous tunnel across the face. In the normal cheek 3-4 fascicles of the nerve were anastomosed to facial nerve branches innervating muscles elevating the angle of the mouth. Four to 13 months later the extensor digitorum brevis muscle to the second toe or the palmaris longus was transplanted to the paralysed cheek. It was attached between the zygomatic arch and the angle of the mouth. The end of the nerve was sutured to the muscle after taking a biopsy. The follow-up period has been 7-30 months. At 7 months 6 patients had positive EMG, either on voluntary movement or on stimulation of the contralateral facial nerve. Three of them had also a slight movement in the cheek. Two patients are as yet only 7 months postoperative. In the remaining two cases, No. 2 and 4, there were no signs of reinnervation. At 18 months 4 out of 6 patients had a synchronous natural contraction in the cheek giving increased balance to the mouth. These patients had a positive EMG. In patients No. 2 and 4 there was neither innervation nor improvement. At 30 months there was additional improvement in two cases but as previously in patients No. 2 and 4 there was neither improvement nor signs of innervation of the muscle on the EMG.

Facial nerve reconstruction was accomplished along the anatomical course of the facial nerve from its origin at the brainstem, within the mastoid, at the stylomastoid foramen and within the face. Mostly, reconstruction was indicated because of nerve discontinuity (n = 61), whereas facial nerve reanimation with a donor nerve such as the contralateral facial nerve or the ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve was indicated in 99 cases of loss of a proximal nerve stump. Depending on the site of the lesion reinnervation started at 5 to 15 months postoperatively lasting for 2 to 3 years with overall satisfactory results. 69% of all the patients regained good symmetry on rest, complete eye closure equivalent to House-Brackmann-Score III: Patients with complete failures either suffered of non-related diseases such as cancer leading to death before the estimated time of recovery or were exposed to radiation or received facial nerve reconstruction after long-standing facial deficit and marked muscular atrophy. The indication of the adequate method depends on the clinical course with or without preexisting facial paresis, on considering the intraoperative state of the facial nerve. the identification and microsurgical preparation of adequate nerve stumps, as well as on the adaptation techniques and the postoperative guidance of the patient.

9092841,Embase,Management of 1000 vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas): The facial nerve - Preservation and restitution of function,"OBJECTIVE: Although the rate of reported facial nerve preservation after surgery for vestibular schwannomas continuously increases, facial nerve paresis or paralysis is a frequent postsurgical sequelae of major concern. The major goal of this study was to define criteria for the right indication, timing, and type of therapy for patients with palsies despite anatomic nerve continuity and those with loss of anatomic continuity. METHODS: One thousand vestibular schwannomas were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery at Nordstadt Hospital from 1978 to 1993. Of 979 cases of complete removal and 21 cases of deliberately partial removal, the facial nerve was anatomically preserved in 929 cases (93%). The rate of preservation is increasing, as is evidenced in the most recent cases, and preservation is supported by special electrophysiological monitoring. The facial nerve was anatomically severed in 60 cases (6%). It was anatomically lost in previous operations that were performed elsewhere in 11 cases (1%). In case of nerve discontinuity (42 cases), immediate nerve reconstruction by one of three available intracranial procedures (within the cerebellopontine angle, intracranial-intratemporal, intracranial-extracranial) was performed in the same surgical setting. In case of loss of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem, early reanimation by combination with the hypoglossal nerve was achieved in most patients within weeks after tumor surgery. In a few patients with anatomic nerve continuity but absence of reinnervation for 10 to 12 months, a hypoglossal-facial combination was applied. All the patients with partial or with complete palsies were treated in a special follow-up program of regular controls and of modulation of physiotherapeutic treatment every 3 to 6 months. RESULTS: In intracranial nerve reconstruction at the cerebellopontine angle, 61 to 70% of patients regained complete eye closure and an overall result equivalent to House-Brackmann Grade 3. Hypoglossal- facial reanimation led to Grade 3 in 79%. The duration between the onset of paralysis and the reconstructive procedure is decisive for the quality of the outcome. These data are discussed in view of other treatment options and certain parameters influencing outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This management contains three major principles as follows: 1) preservation of facial nerve continuity in function by the aid of intraoperative monitoring, 2) early nerve reconstruction in case of lost continuity, and 3) scheduled follow-up program for all patients with incomplete or complete palsies.",3,,0,0,9,9,2,1,0,1000,3,6,,,,,,,,neg: facial asymmetry and lagophthalmus,,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

The segmental latissimus dorsi was taken from the distal part of the muscle so that the muscle flap had an ultra-long neurovascular pedicle of 13 to 17.5 cm in length. The muscle flap was made thinner by splitting the segmental muscle. The split segmental muscle flap was transferred to the paralyzed side of the face with its ultra-long neurovascular pedicle passing through a tunnel in the upper lip to the normal side of the face. The neurovascular pedicle of the muscle flap was anastomosed with the facial nerve, artery, and veins, respectively, on the normal side of the face. The operation was designed without the cross-facial nerve graft stage. From 1986 to October of 1997, 86 patients with longstanding facial paralysis were treated in our department. The duration of facial palsy in this series ranged from 1.5 to 51 years. A satisfactory result was obtained in 80 cases, evaluated at 8 months to 2 years postoperatively. The expression movement of the soft tissues of the face can be seen not only over transferred muscle but also on the paralyzed muscle covered by the splitting muscle flap.

15468391,Pub-med,Dynamic reconstruction of eye closure by muscle transposition or functional muscle transplantation in facial palsy,"For patients with facial palsy, lagophthalmus is often a more serious problem than the inability to smile. Dynamic reconstruction of eye closure by muscle transposition or by free functional muscle transplantation offers a good solution for regaining near-normal eye protection without the need for implants. This is the first quantitative study of three-dimensional preoperative and postoperative lid movements in patients treated for facial paralysis. Between February of 1998 and April of 2002, 44 patients were treated for facial palsy, including reconstruction of eye closure. Temporalis muscle transposition to the eye was used in 34 cases, and a regionally differentiated part of a free gracilis muscle transplant after double cross-face nerve grafting was used in 10 cases. Patients' facial movements were documented by a three-dimensional video analysis system preoperatively and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. For this comparative study, only the data of patients with preoperative and 12-month postoperative measurements were included. In the 27 patients with a final result after temporalis muscle transposition for eye closure, the distance between the upper and lower eyelid points during eye closing (as for sleep) was reduced from 10.33 +/- 2.43 mm (mean +/- SD) preoperatively to 5.84 +/- 4.34 mm postoperatively on the paralyzed side, compared with 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm preoperatively and postoperatively on the contralateral healthy side. In the resting position, preoperative values for the paralyzed side changed from 15.11 +/- 1.92 mm preoperatively to 13.46 +/- 1.94 mm postoperatively, compared with 12.17 +/- 2.02 mm preoperatively and 12.05 +/- 1.95 mm postoperatively on the healthy side. In the nine patients with a final result after surgery using a part of the free gracilis muscle transplant reinnervated by a zygomatic branch of the contralateral healthy side through a cross-face nerve graft, eyelid closure changed from 10.21 +/- 2.72 mm to 1.68 +/- 1.35 mm, compared with 13.70 +/- 1.56 mm to 6.63 +/- 1.51 mm preoperatively. The average closure for the healthy side was from 11.20 +/- 3.11 mm to 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm preoperatively and from 12.70 +/- 1.95 mm to 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm postoperatively. In three cases, the resting tonus of the part of the gracilis muscle transplant around the eye had increased to an extent that muscle weakening became necessary. Temporalis muscle transposition and free functional muscle transplantation for reanimation of the eye and mouth at the same time are reliable methods for reconstructing eye closure, with clinically adequate results. Detailed analysis of the resulting facial movements led to an important improvement of the authors' operative techniques within the last few years. Thus, the number of secondary operative corrections could be significantly reduced. These qualitative and quantitative studies of the reconstructed lid movements by three-dimensional video analysis support the authors' clinical concept of temporalis muscle transposition being the first-choice method in adult patients with facial palsy. In children, free muscle transplantation is preferred for eye closure, so as not to interfere with the growth of the face by transposition of a masticatory muscle. In addition, a higher degree of central plasticity in children might be expected.",0,,2,1,5,9,4,1,0,44,6,24,,,,,,,,"Tools: clinical evaluatio Outcomes: distance between upper and lower eyelid (preop vs postop), symmetry, synkinesia",,,,no nerve transfer,,,['Alt flap'],Alt,,,,
15692342,Embase,Neurovascularized free short head of the biceps femoris muscle transfer for one-stage reanimation of facial paralysis,"The single-stage technique for cross-face reanimation of the paralyzed face without nerve graft is an improvement over the two-stage procedure because it results in early reinnervation of the transferred muscle and shortens the period of rehabilitation. On the basis of an anatomic investigation, the short head of the biceps femoris muscle with attached lateral intermuscular septum of the thigh was identified as a new candidate for microneurovascular free muscle transfer. The authors performed one-stage transfer of the short head of the biceps femoris muscle with a long motor nerve for reanimation of established facial paralysis in seven patients. The dominant nutrient vessels of the short head were the profunda perforators (second or third) in six patients and the direct branches from the popliteal vessels in one patient. The recipient vessels were the facial vessels in all cases. The length of the motor nerve of the short head ranged from 10 to 16 cm, and it was sutured directly to several zygomatic and buccal branches of the contralateral facial nerve in six patients. One patient required an interpositional nerve graft of 3 cm to reach the suitable facial nerve branches on the intact side. The period required for initial voluntary movement of the transferred muscles ranged from 4 to 10 months after the procedures. The period of postoperative follow-up ranged from 5 to 42 months. Transfer of the vascularized innervated short head of the biceps femoris muscle is thought to be an alternative for one-stage reconstruction of the paralyzed face because of the reliable vascular anatomy of the muscle and because it allows two teams to operate together without the need to reposition the patient. The nerve to the short head of the biceps femoris enters the side opposite the vascular pedicle of the muscle belly, and this unique relationship between the vascular pedicle and the motor nerve is anatomically suitable for one-stage reconstruction of the paralyzed face. As much as to 16 cm of the nerve can be harvested, and the nerve is long enough to reach the contralateral intact facial nerve in almost all cases. The lateral intermuscular septum, which is attached to the short head, provides ""anchor/suture-bearing"" tissue, allowing reliable fixations to the zygoma and the upper and lower lips to be achieved. In addition, the scar and deformity of the donor site are acceptable, and loss of this muscle does not result in donor-site dysfunction.",4,,2,3,0,9,8,3,0,7,4,10,,,,,,,,"pos: smile and symmetry

15793421,Embase,A comparison of surgical techniques used in dynamic reanimation of the paralyzed face,"Objectives: To compare the outcomes of three surgical techniques used in the rehabilitation of the paralyzed face. Study Design: Retrospective study. Setting: University-based tertiary referral center. Patients: Between 1976 and 2000, rehabilitative facial nerve surgery was performed on 70 adult patients with varying underlying diseases. Intervention: Three methods of facial nerve rehabilitative surgery were performed: end-to-end anastomosis, cable nerve graft interposition, and classic faciohypoglossal transposition. Main Outcome Measures: The House-Brackmann grade was scored at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months by the two senior authors. A favorable outcome was defined as House-Brackmann Grade ‚Äö√¢¬ß III. Other parameters recorded were repair technique, age, nerve rerouting, whether the repair was immediate or delayed, and the anatomic position of the nerve defect in relation to the geniculate ganglion. Results: Data were available on 66 patients (94%), of whom 13 had an end-to-end anastomosis, 25 a cable nerve graft interposition, and 28 a classic faciohypoglossal transposition. At 24 months, a House-Brackmann Grade ‚Äö√¢¬ß III was achieved in 84.6% of those who underwent end-to-end anastomosis, 56.0% of those who underwent cable nerve graft interposition, and 25.0% of those who underwent classical faciohypoglossal transposition. End-to-end anastomosis and cable nerve graft interposition were superior to classic faciohypoglossal transposition (log-rank test, p = 0.0013). Twenty-five percent of all cases demonstrated improvement in House-Brackmann grade after 24 months. Increasing age at the time of repair was associated with a poorer outcome (p = 0.03 on logistic regression). Conclusion: End-to-end anastomosis confers the best facial function, followed by cable nerve graft interposition and then classic faciohypoglossal transposition. Contrary to some previous opinions, improvement in facial function can still occur 2 years after surgical repair, particularly with classic faciohypoglossal transposition. ¬¨¬© 2005, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.",4,,0,0,10,9,2,1,0,66,6,36,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,anastomosis","end-to-end anastomosis, cable nerve graft interposition, and classic faciohypoglossal transposition.",neg:failure/HB score not improved,,,,Undefined interposition nerve transfer,Faciohypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,

Methods: Facial function was assessed after operation using a 7-point visual analog scale (VAS) and by electromyography (EMG) in 53 patients. The final result was judged by May's facial nerve grading system. Results: Voluntary EMG activity occurred on average 4.52 ¬¨¬± 1.31 months after operation.

16794958,Pub-med,[Results of 13 hypoglosso-facial anastomoses],"Background and purpose: Facial nerve paralysis significantly decreases the quality of life in patients after skull base tumors surgery. There are different options for surgical repair of the nerve. One of the most effective methods is the anastomosis of the distal trunk of the facial nerve with the proximal trunk of the hypoglossal nerve or with hypoglossal loop. Material and methods: Thirteen hypoglosso-facial anastomoses had been performed in our department between 1999 and 2003. In all patients the facial nerve paralysis was due to the surgery in its proximity. In one case the patient suffered from petroclival chordoma, in one case ameloblastoma, one was with petroclival meningioma and the rest of cases were after vestibular schwannoma. The follow-up period lasted from 6 months to three years. The final result was expressed in House-Brackmann scale (HB) describing facial muscle strength. Results: In two cases there was no improvement (HB 6), in two cases barely perceptible motion (HB 5), in five obvious weekness with disfiguring assymetry (HB 4) and in four obvious but not disfiguring dysfunction (HB 3). There was only one postoperative complication haematoma at the place of anastomosis requiring evacuation. Conclusion: Hypoglosso-facial anastomosis remains one of the most important techniques of the reanimation of the paralysed face. Its efficacy is limited, but it is a relatively safe procedure.",3,,0,0,9,9,2,1,0,13,6,36,,,,,,Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,repeat,"repeat/Tools: HB scores Outcomes: facial muscle strenght,complications(hematoma)",,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

Study design: Retrospective study. Setting: University-based tertiary referral center. Patients: Nine patients who underwent facial-hypoglossal transfer surgery between 2001 and 2006 to treat a unilateral complete facial nerve palsy. Intervention: The facial nerve is mobilized in the temporal bone, transsected at the second genu, transferred and directly coaptated to a partially incised hypoglossal nerve. Main outcome measures: The House-Brackmann grading system was used to evaluate facial nerve reinnervation. Tongue atrophy and movements were documented. Quality of life related to facial function was assessed using the validated Facial Disability Index. Results: A House-Brackmann Grade III (86%) was achieved in six patients, and Grade IV (14%) in one patient with an average follow-up of 22 months (range, 12-48 mo). Two patients had a follow-up of less than 12 months after surgery, and reinnervation was still in progress. In none of the patients who were operated on was tongue atrophy or impaired movement observed. Postoperative Facial Disability Index scores (mean, 71.8 +/- standard deviation [SD] 10.6) for physical functioning and social functioning (mean, 85.7 +/- SD 9.8) were increased for all patients when compared with preoperative scores (mean, 28.6 +/- SD 9.0; mean, 37.7 +/- SD 14.4, respectively). Conclusion: The facial-hypoglossal nerve transfer with direct coaptation of the intratemporal part of the facial nerve offers good functional results with low lingual morbidity and improved quality of life.

17589268,Embase,Nerve sources for facial reanimation with muscle transplant in patients with unilateral facial palsy: Clinical analysis of 3 techniques,"Ninety-one patients with long-standing unilateral facial palsy and submitted to reanimation of the face with muscle transplant were divided into 3 nonrandomized groups: group I: 2-stage facial reanimation, cross face followed by gracilis muscle transplant, 58 patients; group II: 1-stage reanimation with latissimus dorsi muscle transplant, 11 patients (a branch of the facial nerve on the nonparalyzed side of the face was used as the nerve source for reanimation in groups I and II); group III: 1-stage reanimation with gracilis muscle transplant and neural coaptation of the respective nerve and the ipsilateral masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve, 22 patients. No microvascular complications were observed. The average interval between surgery and initial muscle contractions was 11.1 months, 7.2 months, and 3.7 months in group I, group II, and group III, respectively. The quality (intensity and shape) of the smile, voluntary or involuntary, obtained on the reanimated side in relation to the unaffected side was considered good or excellent in 53.4%, 54.5%, and 86.3% of the patients in groups I, II, and III, respectively. In group I, the average age of the patients with excellent or good results (19.8 + 10.5 years) was significantly lower than that of the patients with fair or poor results or absence of movement (36.5 + 13.3 years). The smile was considered emotional or involuntary in 34% of the patients in group I and 45% in group II. Most of the patients in each group were only able to produce ""voluntary smiles"". Crossed synkinesis with lip puckering was observed in 48% of the patients in group I and 90% in group II.

19010754,Pub-med,Dual innervation method using one-stage reconstruction with free latissimus dorsi muscle transfer for re-animation of established facial paralysis: simultaneous reinnervation of the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve and the contralateral facial nerve to improve the quality of smile and emotional facial expressions,"Background: One-stage microneurovascular free muscle transfer is a common surgical procedure for re-animation of established facial paralysis. However, innervation of the transferred muscle by the contralateral facial nerve prevents smile and other facial expressions on one side, and reinnervation requires about 7 months. To overcome these drawbacks, we report a dual innervation method using one-stage reconstruction with free latissimus dorsi muscle transfer. Methods: Three patients were treated with the dual innervation method, which is based on the one-stage method with some modifications: the soft tissue present over the ipsilateral masseter muscle and the hilum where the thoracodorsal nerve proceeds into the muscle segment is removed; the muscle is harvested to locate the hilum in the cranial one-third of the segment; and the muscle is transferred to the malar pocket of the paralysed face such that the hilum contacts the masseter muscle. Results: On average, muscle movement was recognised on voluntary biting at 3.4 months and on spontaneous smiling at 5.9 months after surgery. A dual innervation sign was recorded on electromyographs 6.4 months after surgery. The patients developed a spontaneous symmetrical smile and facial expressions on one side with minimum synkinesis after postoperative mirror rehabilitation. Conclusions: The advantages of the dual innervation method include faster reinnervation of the transferred muscle compared to one-stage options; achievement of spontaneous smile and voluntary smile on each side; augmentation of neural signals to the muscle for more symmetrical smiling; minimum synkinesis of the transferred muscle on biting for eyelid closure and emotional facial re-animation through a learning program to enhance cerebral cortical reorganisation.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,2,1,1,9,8,3,0,3,3,6,,,,,,,,,,,,Double innervation,,,['Latissimus dorsi flap'],Latissimus dorsi flap,,,,

The ages of the patients ranged from 5 to 63 years (mean: 44.1 years), and 8 (80%) of the patients were females. The duration of paralysis was no longer than 18 months (mean: 9.7 months). Follow-up varied from 6 to 18 months (mean: 12.6 months). Initial voluntary facial movements were observed between 3 and 6 months postoperatively (mean: 4.3 months). All patients were able to produce the appearance of a smile when asked to clench their teeth. Comparing the definition of the nasolabial fold and the degree of movement of the modiolus on both sides of the face, the voluntary smile was considered symmetrical in 8 cases. Recovery of the capacity to blink spontaneously was not observed. However, 8 patients were able to reduce or suspend the application of artificial tears.

20595862,Pub-med,"Intraoperative muscle electrical stimulation for accurate positioning of the temporalis muscle tendon during dynamic, one-stage lengthening temporalis myoplasty for facial and lip reanimation","Background: Facial paralysis is a significant functional and aesthetic handicap. Facial reanimation is performed either by two-stage microsurgical methods or by regional one-stage muscle pedicle flaps. Labb‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© has modified and improved the regional muscle pedicle transfer flaps for facial reanimation (i.e., the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure). This true myoplasty technique is capable of producing a coordinated, spontaneous, and symmetrical smile. An intraoperative electrical stimulation of the temporal muscle is proposed to simulate the smile of the paralyzed side on the surgical table. Methods: The intraoperative electrical stimulation of the temporalis muscle, employing direct percutaneous electrode needles or transcutaneous electrical stimulation electrodes, was utilized in 11 primary and four secondary cases with complete facial palsy. The duration of the facial paralysis was up to 12 years. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months. Results: The insertion points of the temporalis muscle tendon to the nasolabial fold, upper lip, and oral commissure had been changed according to the intraoperative muscle stimulation in six patients of the 11 primary cases (55 percent) and in all four secondary (revisional) cases. A coordinated, spontaneous, and symmetrical smile was achieved in all patients by 3 months after surgery by employing speech therapy and biofeedback. Conclusion: This adjunct intraoperative refinement provides crucial feedback for the surgeon in both primary and secondary facial palsy cases regarding the vector of action of the temporalis muscle and the accuracy of the anchoring points of its tendon, thus enhancing a more coordinated and symmetrical smile.",0,,0,1,0,9,4,1,0,11,3,12,,,,,,,,,,,,no nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

The loss of function of one or both facial nerves has a remarkable impact on patients' lives. Objective: To retrospectively analyze the functional outcomes of microneurovascular facial reanimation using masseteric innervation. Methods: Seventeen patients with irreparable facial paralysis resulting from benign lesions involving the facial nuclei (n = 14) or M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome (n = 3) were treated with free muscle flaps for oral commissural reanimation using ipsilateral masseteric innervation and using temporalis muscle transfer for eyelid reanimation. Results were analyzed by the absolute commissural excursion and commissural excursion index and by a patient self-evaluation score. Presence of synkinesis was documented. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean, 26.4 months). Results: Normalization of the commissural excursion index was observed in 8 of 17 patients (47%), an improvement was seen in 7 of 17 (41%), and failure was observed in 2 of 17 (12%). The individual dynamics of absolute commissural excursion and commissural excursion index changes are presented. A natural smiling response was observed in 10 of 17 patients (59%) but not in the remaining 7 (41%). This response reflected the patient's ability to relay the natural emotion of smiling through the masseteric nerve. Patients' self-evaluation scores were a level higher than objective indices. CONCLUSIONS: Innervation of free muscle flaps with the masseteric nerve for oral commissure reanimation might play an important role in patients with lesions of the facial nuclei (as in M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome). Synkinesis persists for long periods after surgery. However, most of the patients learned to express their emotions by overcoming this phenomenon.

21463951,Embase,Masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis for early facial reanimation,"Objective: Early repair of facial nerve paralysis when cortical neural input cannot be provided by the facial nerve nucleus, is generally accomplished anastomozing the extracranial stump of the facial nerve to a motor donor nerve. That is generally the hypoglossus, which carries a variable degree of morbidity. The present work aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the masseteric nerve as donor for early facial reanimation, with the advantage that harvesting is associated with negligible morbidity. Methods: Between October 2007 and August 2009, 7 patients (2 males, 5 women) with unilateral facial paralysis underwent a masseter-facial nerves anastomosis with an interpositional nerve graft of the great auricular nerve. The interval between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean 19.2 months). All patients included in the study had signs of facial mimetic muscle fibrillations on electromyography. The degree of preoperative facial nerve dysfunction was grade VI following the House-Brackmann scale for all patients. Results: At the time of the study, all the patients with a minimum follow-up time of 12 months after the onset of mimetic function had recovered facial animation. Facial muscles showed signs of recovery within 2-9 months, mean 4.8 months, with the restoration of facial symmetry at rest. Facial movements appeared while the patients activated their chewing musculature. Morbidity related to this intervention is only the loss of sensitivity of earlobe and preauricular region. Conclusion: The present technique seems to be a valid alternative to classical hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis because of similar facial nerve recovery and lower morbidity. ¬¨¬© 2011 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.",2,,0,3,9,9,8,3,0,7,2,9,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:masseteric nerve,hypoglossal,Great auricular nerve",,"neg: loss of sensitivity of earlobe and preauricular region, synkinesis

Motion developed an average of 5.6 months after masseter-to-facial nerve transfer, with 40 percent of patients developing an effortless smile by postoperative month 19. Conclusions: The masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is an effective method for reanimation of the miDFace and perioral region in a select group of facial paralysis patients.

Methods: Patients who had undergone radical parotidectomy with a large defect of the facial fan, reconstruction of the upper face by facial nerve interpositional graft, and reconstruction of the lower face by hypoglossal-facial nerve jump nerve suture were included in this series. Results: Four patients underwent the modified combined approach after tumor resection and prior to postoperative radiotherapy in three of the four cases. Surgery was combined with an upper lid weight implantation. Regeneration of the face was successful in all cases within 12 to 16 months. Most important, the separated reanimation of the upper and lower face circumvented synkinesis of the upper and lower face. This factor was essential for good functional results. Using the hypoglossal jump technique instead of a classical cross-nerve suture technique prevented the sacrifice of ipsilateral tongue function. Conclusions: The presented method offers satisfactory results for facial reanimation and avoids synkinesis between the upper and lower face.

Thus, various attempts have been made to modify this method to reduce the tongue damage. The aim of this report was to present the results of hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HHFA) technique in relation to facial muscles reanimation and hemitongue atrophy. Material and methods: The first 7 consecutive patients who underwent CN VII anastomosis with half of the CNXII, for which the follow-up period exceeded 12 months, were analysed. During the procedure, CN VII was transected as proximally as possible after drilling the mastoid process. CN XII was separated longitudinally into two parts at a short distance to allow suture of the stumps without any tension. One half of CN XII was transected and sutured to the distal stump of CN VII. Recovery from facial palsy was quantified with the House-Brackmann grading system (HB). Tongue function was assessed according to the scale proposed by Martins. Results: Features of initial reinnervation of facial muscles were visible after 6 months in all 7 patients. All patients achieved satisfactory outcome of CN VII regeneration (HB grade III) until the last control examination (12-27 months after surgery, mean 16). No or minimal tongue atrophy without deviation (grades I-II according to the Martins scale) was found in 4 patients. Mild hemiatrophy with tongue deviation < 30 degrees (grade III) was visible in 3 patients.

22728067,Embase,Double innervation in free-flap surgery for long-standing facial paralysis,"Objective: One-stage free-flap facial reanimation may be accomplished by using a gracilis transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve, but this technique does not restore the patient's ability to smile spontaneously. By contrast, the transfer of the latissimus dorsi innervated by the contralateral facial nerve provides the correct nerve stimulus but is limited by variation in the quantity of contraction. The authors propose a new one-stage facial reanimation technique using dual innervation; a gracilis muscle flap is innervated by the masseteric nerve, and supplementary nerve input is provided by a cross-face sural nerve graft anastomosed to the contralateral facial nerve branch. Methods: Between October 2009 and March 2010, four patients affected by long-standing unilateral facial paralysis received gracilis muscle transfers innervated by both the masseteric nerve and the contralateral facial nerve. Results: All patients recovered voluntary and spontaneous smiling abilities. The recovery time to voluntary flap contraction was 3.8 months, and spontaneous flap contraction was achieved within 7.2 months after surgery. According to Terzis and Noah's five-stage classification of reanimation outcomes, two patients had excellent outcomes and two had good outcomes. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, the devised double-innervation technique allows to achieve a good grade of flap contraction as well as emotional smiling ability. A wider number of operated patients are needed to confirm those initial findings. ¬¨¬© 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

The two-stage gracilis muscle transfer combined with the cross-face nerve graft (two-stage method) has been supplanted by one-stage reconstruction using the latissimus dorsi muscle (LD) at our institution. This study retrospectively evaluated the results of one-stage LD transfer. Methods: Between September 1993 and December 2008, 344 patients (133 males, 211 females; age range, 5-75 years) with unilateral facial paralysis underwent 351 one-stage LD transfers. Patients were evaluated with a custom grading scale. Differences in grading scale score were compared according to age, past surgical history and the duration from operation to neuromuscular recovery. Results: Contraction of the transferred muscle was recognised in 305 (87.0%) transfers. The duration until neuromuscular recovery ranged from 3 to 16 months (average ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± standard deviation: 6.48 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.92 months). The grading scale was significantly lower in middle-age group than in younger and elder groups (P < 0.01). Duration until neuromuscular recovery was significantly different when comparing the younger group and the oldest group. There was no difference in grading scale score or in duration until neuromuscular recovery when comparing the patients with a past surgical history and those without.

23096620,Pub-med,Comparison of hemihypoglossal nerve versus masseteric nerve transpositions in the rehabilitation of short-term facial paralysis using the Facial Clima evaluating system,"Background: Masseteric and hypoglossal nerve transfers are reliable alternatives for reanimating short-term facial paralysis. To date, few studies exist in the literature comparing these techniques. This work presents a quantitative comparison of masseter-facial transposition versus hemihypoglossal facial transposition with a nerve graft using the Facial Clima system. Methods: Forty-six patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis underwent reanimation with either hemihypoglossal transposition with a nerve graft (group I, n = 25) or direct masseteric-facial coaptation (group II, n = 21). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the Facial Clima system. Postoperative intragroup commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity means of the reanimated versus the normal side were first compared using a paired sample t test. Then, mean percentages of recovery of both parameters were compared between the groups using an independent sample t test. Onset of movement was also compared between the groups. Results: Significant differences of mean commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity between the reanimated side and the normal side were observed in group I but not in group II. Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters did not differ between the groups. Patients in group II showed a significantly faster onset of movement compared with those in group I (62 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 4.6 days versus 136 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 7.4 days, p = 0.013). Conclusions: Reanimation of short-term facial paralysis can be satisfactorily addressed by means of either hemihypoglossal transposition with a nerve graft or direct masseteric-facial coaptation. However, with the latter, better symmetry and a faster onset of movement are observed. In addition, masseteric nerve transfer avoids morbidity from nerve graft harvesting.

The current gold standard in facial reanimation is revascularized re-innervated muscle transfers. Materials and methods: In this paper, we report the results of a new method using the gracilis flap with a double innervation on the masseter motor nerve and the controlateral facial nerve via a sural graft in a single stage intervention, on a series of six patients. Results: No failure was observed. The average delay of a voluntary contraction was 3.8. months, and 7.2. months for a spontaneous one. Three of the six patients had ""excellent"" results according to the Terzis and Noah classification, two were classified as ""good"" and one ""average"" Discussion: A choice is to be made between a method advocating a natural and spontaneous dynamicity (controlateral facial nerve stimulus) and a method focusing on the quality and quantity of contractions (ipsilateral trijeminal stimulus). In this new technique, we combine the two methods: a free gracilis transfer with a dual innervation on the healthy controlateral facial nerve via a sural graft, on one hand, and a second anastomosis on the ipsilateral masseter nerve, on the other hand. Conclusion: This new proposed method seems to be, according to our results, a reliable technique rallying voluntary contraction and emotional smile. ¬¨¬© 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,3,0,9,2,1,0,6,4,7,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:masseter nerve,anastomosis",,"Tools: Terzis' and Noah classification, Outcome: clinical evaluation",,,,Double innervation,,,,,,,,

The use of an interposition graft and its end-to-side anastomosis to the hypoglossal nerve allows the preservation of the tongue function and also requires two anastomosis sites and a free second donor nerve. We describe the modified technique of the hypoglossal-facial-jump-anastomosis without an interposition and present the first results. Study Design Retrospective case study. Methods We performed the facial nerve reconstruction in five patients. The indication for the surgery was a long-standing facial paralysis with preserved portion distal to geniculate ganglion, absent voluntary activity in the needle facial electromyography, and an intact bilateral hypoglossal nerve. Following mastoidectomy, the facial nerve was mobilized in the fallopian canal down to its bifurcation in the parotid gland and cut in its tympanic portion distal to the lesion. Then, a tensionless end-to-side suture to the hypoglossal nerve was performed. The facial function was monitored up to 16 months postoperatively. Results The reconstruction technique succeeded in all patients: The facial function improved within the average time period of 10 months to the House-Brackmann score 3. Conclusion This modified technique of the hypoglossal-facial reanimation is a valid method with good clinical results, especially in cases of a preserved intramastoidal facial nerve.

Currently, the techniques available for reanimation of these patients include hypoglossal nerve transposition, free muscle transfer, and cross-face nerve grafting (CFNG). Between December 2008 and March 2012, eight patients with incomplete unilateral facial paralysis were reanimated with two-stage CFNG. Gender, age at surgery, etiology of paralysis denervation time, donor and recipient nerves, presence of facial synkinesis, and follow-up were registered.

If primary reconstruction fails, a second muscle transfer is usually needed. Herein, we investigated the possibility of avoiding a second free muscle transfer by in situ coaptation of the gracilis muscle to the masseteric nerve.OBSERVATIONS: We report a series of 3 failed free muscle transfers for facial reanimation among 21 free flap transfers performed for facial reanimation between March 2008 and August 2013. To salvage the muscle, we performed coaptation of the neural pedicle from the cross-facial nerve graft to the masseteric nerve. This method allows for leaving the fixation sutures of the muscle at the oral commissure in place. All patients showed muscle contraction after 3 months and a smile with open mouth after 6 months. No significant difference in the range of commissure excursion was observed between the healthy and operated sides.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recoaptation of the neural pedicle from the cross-facial nerve graft to the masseteric nerve, leaving the muscle transplant in place, is a suitable salvage procedure after unsuccessful reconstruction with a cross-facial nerve graft, avoiding a second free muscle transfer.4.",1,,2,0,6,9,8,3,0,21,3,6,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:cross-facial,masseteric nerve",,,,,,Cross-facial nerve transfer,,,['Alt flap'],Alt,,,,

This article reports that this procedure is effective and associated with minimal morbidities. Methods: From November 2010 to February 2013, 16 patients underwent a masseter-to-facial nerve transfer. Their denervation periods varied from 2 to 18 months, with an average of 10.1¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±4.1 months. Their ages varied from 22 to 70 years, with an average of 34.7¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬±15.4 years. The etiology of denervation was tumor resection in the cerebellopontine angle in all cases. All of the patients were followed up several times. The outcomes of the first follow-up at 3 months postoperatively and the last follow-up at a minimum 12 months postoperatively were documented. Using Terzis' and Metha's scales, the smile outcomes and synkinetic movements as visualized using standardized videos were graded preoperatively and postoperatively. The periods between the operation and the onset of mimetic muscle contraction were documented. A questionnaire was administered to evaluate the donor-site morbidity and the ability to smile without biting. Results: The final outcomes for smile function were as follows: 9 patients (56.3%) had excellent or good function, 5 patients (31.3%) had moderate function, and 2 patients (12.5%) had poor function. There was significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative time points and between the outcomes at the first and last follow-ups (P<0.05). Additionally, 13 (81.3%) patients had the ability to smile without biting 12 months postoperatively. The onset of muscle motion varied from 56 to 365 days and was positively correlated with age in the group of patients older than 40 years and negatively correlated with the outcome of the first follow-up. Four (25%) patients complained of concavity at the parotideomasseteric region, but none complained of disturbance in food intake. Synkinetic movements were observed in all patients and were rated as mild. Conclusions: The masseter-facial nerve transfer effectively reanimated the paralytic muscle in patients who acquired an intracranial facial nerve injury with minimal deficits at the donor site.

25819029,Pub-med,One-stage dual latissimus dorsi muscle flap transfer with a pair of vascular anastomoses and double nerve suturing for long-standing facial paralysis,"Objective: Various types of neurovascular free-muscle transfers have been reported as surgical treatments for long-standing facial paralysis. Among one-stage methods, two approaches, that is, latissimus dorsi transfer with nerve suturing to the contralateral facial nerve and gracilis transfer with nerve suturing to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve, have recently become popular. The former method has the advantage of making spontaneous smiling possible, but the contraction strength of the transferred muscle varies, whereas the latter approach has the advantage of guaranteeing voluntary contraction of the transferred muscle, but makes spontaneous smiling difficult. Recently, dual innervation methods have also been reported, but uncertainty remains about the utility of such approaches. To overcome these drawbacks, we devised a hybrid method combining the two previously established techniques. Methods: Two latissimus dorsi muscle flaps containing the thoracodorsal vessels from one side are transferred with a pair of vascular anastomoses. The true trunk of the thoracodorsal nerve, which innervates one of the muscle flaps, is sutured to the contralateral facial nerve, while the short branch of the thoracodorsal nerve, which innervates the other muscle flap, is sutured to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. From November 2011 to October 2013, we used this method in four patients with long-standing facial paralysis. Results: Smiling was assessed in the three patients who were followed up for more than 1 year, and satisfactory results were obtained (Harii score: 4-5). In one patient, the movement mediated via the contralateral facial nerve was a little weak, but this was compensated for by the muscles controlled by the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Conclusion: Our novel one-stage method, which involves a combination of two previously established methods, guarantees early voluntary smiling, and spontaneous smiling becomes possible later. In addition, it is free from the uncertainty associated with double innervation and does not require nerve grafts. So, stable results can be expected in most patients with long-standing facial paralysis.",6,"Masseteric + Thoracodorsal, CFNG + Thoracodorsal",1,0,0,9,4,1,0,4,4,8,,,,,,,,"Tools: clinical examination Outcome: smile, movement, muscle tone LD flap",,,,Double innervation,,,,,,,,
25819525,Pub-med,Comparison of Direct Side-to-End and End-to-End Hypoglossal-Facial Anastomosis for Facial Nerve Repair,"Background: The hypoglossal facial anastomosis (HFA) is the gold standard for facial reanimation in patients with severe facial nerve palsy. The major drawbacks of the classic HFA technique are lingual morbidities due to hypoglossal nerve transection. The side-to-end HFA is a modification of the classic technique with fewer tongue-related morbidities. Objectives: In this study we compared the outcome of the classic end-to-end and the direct side-to-end HFA surgeries performed at our center in regards to the facial reanimation success rate and tongue-related morbidities. Methods: Twenty-six successive cases of HFA were enrolled. In 9 of them end-to-end anastomoses were performed, and 17 had direct side-to-end anastomoses. The House-Brackmann (HB) and Pitty and Tator (PT) scales were used to document surgical outcome. The hemiglossal atrophy, swallowing, and hypoglossal nerve function were assessed at follow-up. Results: The original pathology was vestibular schwannoma in 15, meningioma in 4, brain stem glioma in 4, and other pathologies in 3. The mean interval between facial palsy and HFA was 18 months (range: 0-60). The median follow-up period was 20 months. The PT grade at follow-up was worse in patients with a longer interval from facial palsy and HFA (P value: 0.041). The lesion type was the only other factor that affected PT grade (the best results in vestibular schwannoma and the worst in the other pathologies group, P value: 0.038). The recovery period for facial tonicity was longer in patients with radiation therapy before HFA (13.5 vs. 8.5 months) and those with a longer than 2-year interval from facial palsy to HFA (13.5 vs. 8.5 months). Although no significant difference between the side-to-end and the end-to-end groups was seen in terms of facial nerve functional recovery, patients from the side-to-end group had a significantly lower rate of lingual morbidities (tongue hemiatrophy: 100% vs. 5.8%, swallowing difficulty: 55% vs. 11.7%, speech disorder 33% vs. 0%). Conclusion: With the side-to-end HFA technique the functional restoration outcome is at least as good as that following the classic end-to-end HFA, but the complications related to the complete hypoglossal nerve transection can be avoided. Best results are achieved if this procedure is performed within the first 2 years after facial nerve injury.

26002778,Pub-med,"End-to-side ""loop"" graft for total facial nerve reconstruction: Over 10 years experience","Background: Multiple-branch reconstruction is required in order to attain facial reanimation for extensive facial nerve defects. We previously reported that end-to-side nerve grafting, with the use of a single nerve graft for defect reconstruction, was easy to perform. We have also demonstrated the efficacy of end-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve to the donor graft nerve, in experimental rat models and clinical cases. The regenerating axons, which extended into the nerve graft, were ""distributed"" to multiple recipient nerves via end-to-side nerve-suture sites. Methods: Thirty-two patients who underwent facial nerve reconstruction (five to 10 branches) had a single sural nerve graft coapted to the proximal stump of the facial nerve in an end-to-end manner, followed by end-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve stumps to the side of the nerve graft. In 19 patients who were expected to undergo postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, the distal end of the graft was connected to the side of the hypoglossal nerve for ""axonal supercharging,"" to enhance the recovery of the facial muscles. Results: Initial facial movements were noted at 5-12 months postoperatively, and good recovery (House-Brackmann grade III/IV) was observed during long-term follow-up in most patients. Conclusion: End-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve stumps to the nerve graft requires less graft nerve material and less technical mastery to reconstruct multiple branches of the facial nerve. We also described the concept of ""axonal supercharging,"" namely the connection of double-donor neural sources to the graft, and ""axonal distribution,"" namely the reinnervation of multiple recipient nerve stumps connected to the graft in an end-to-side manner.

26026222,Pub-med,Double-powered free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation: A longitudinal optoelectronic study,"The choice of the motor donor nerve is a crucial point in free flap transfer algorithms. In the case of unilateral facial paralysis, the contralateral healthy facial nerve can provide coordinated smile animation and spontaneous emotional expression, but with unpredictable axonal ingrowth into the recipient muscle. Otherwise, the masseteric nerve ipsilateral to the paralysis can provide a powerful neural input, without a spontaneous trigger of the smile. Harvesting a bulky muscular free flap may enhance the quantity of contraction but esthetic results are unpleasant. Therefore, the logical solution for obtaining high amplitude of smiling combined with spontaneity of movement is to couple the neural input: the contralateral facial nerve plus the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Thirteen patients with unilateral dense facial paralysis underwent a one-stage facial reanimation with a gracilis flap powered by a double donor neural input, provided by both the ipsilateral masseteric nerve (coaptation by an end-to-end neurorrhaphy with the obturator nerve) and the contralateral facial nerve (coaptation through a cross-face nerve graft: end-to-end neurorrhaphy on the healthy side and end-to-side neurorrhaphy on the obturator nerve, distal to the masseteric/obturator neurorrhaphy). Their facial movements were evaluated with an optoelectronic motion analyzer. Before surgery, on average, the paretic side exhibited a smaller total three-dimensional mobility than the healthy side, with a 52% activation ratio and >30% of asymmetry. After surgery, the differences significantly decreased (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p < 0.05), with an activation ratio between 75% (maximum smile) and 91% (maximum smile with teeth clenching), and <20% of asymmetry. Similar modifications were seen for the performance of spontaneous smiles. The significant presurgical asymmetry of labial movements reduced after surgery. The use of a double donor neural input permitted both movements that were similar in force to that of the healthy side, and spontaneous movements elicited by emotional triggering.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,0,3,2,8,3,0,13,10,,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:cross-face,masseteric nerve",,tools: clinical and optoelectronic motion analyzer.,,,,Double innervation,,,,,,,,

Objective: To evaluate the use of the pattern of facial paralysis recovery in the early postoperative months as a sole predictor in selecting patients for facial nerve grafting after CPA tumor resection when cranial nerve VII is uninterrupted. Design, setting, and participants: Sixty-two patients with facial paralysis and uninterrupted cranial nerve VII who developed facial paralysis after CPA tumor resection at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were followed up prospectively to assess for spontaneous recovery and to determine candidacy for facial reanimation surgery. The study dates and dates of analysis were January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2015. Interventions: After a minimum of 6 months of clinical follow-up and no signs of clinical recovery, patients underwent facial nerve exploration and a masseteric or hypoglossal nerve transfer. Intraoperative direct nerve stimulation was performed to assess for the presence of subclinical reinnervation. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 18 months after surgery to evaluate outcomes. Main outcomes and measures: Facial function and recovery were studied objectively with a Smile Recovery Scale, Facial Asymmetry Index, and House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. Other outcome measures included the duration of paralysis, time to recovery, and evidence of synkinesis. Results: Sixty-two patients (33 men, 29 women; mean age 51.8 years) with uninterrupted facial nerves after CPA tumor resection developed HB grade IV, V, or VI facial paralysis. Ten patients underwent nerve grafting by 12 months, 9 patients received grafting after 12 months, and 8 patients had no intervention. Thirty-five patients spontaneously recovered. In all patients who underwent nerve grafting, there were no detectable facial muscle movements or electromyographic response to direct facial nerve stimulation suggestive of occult reinnervation. Overall, early facial reanimation surgery resulted in a shorter total duration of paralysis. Masseteric nerve grafting resulted in earlier recovery compared with hypoglossal nerve grafting (5.6 vs 10.8 months, P = .005). Patients who showed no signs of recovery by 6 months after CPA surgery but declined facial reanimation surgery demonstrated at best HB grade V recovery after 18 months of observation. Conclusions and relevance: The recovery pattern in the early postoperative period among patients who develop facial paralysis after CPA tumor resection is a useful clinical tool in selecting patients for facial reanimation surgery. Patients can be counseled for facial reanimation surgery as early as 6 months after surgery because satisfactory facial functional recovery is unlikely to occur when there is no clinical evidence of spontaneous nerve regeneration in the first 6 months.

27035172,Pub-med,Masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy: results of a case series,"OBJECTIVE Facial palsy is a well-known functional and esthetic problem that bothers most patients and affects their social relationships. When the time between the onset of paralysis and patient presentation is less than 18 months and the proximal stump of the injured facial nerve is not available, another nerve must be anastomosed to the facial nerve to reactivate its function. The masseteric nerve has recently gained popularity over the classic hypoglossus nerve as a new motor source because of its lower associated morbidity rate and the relative ease with which the patient can activate it. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy for early facial reanimation. METHODS Thirty-four consecutive patients (21 females, 13 males) with early unilateral facial paralysis underwent masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy in which an interpositional nerve graft of the great auricular or sural nerve was placed. The time between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 2 to 18 months (mean 13.3 months). Electromyography revealed mimetic muscle fibrillations in all the patients. Before surgery, all patients had House-Brackmann Grade VI facial nerve dysfunction. Twelve months after the onset of postoperative facial nerve reactivation, each patient underwent a clinical examination using the modified House-Brackmann grading scale as a guide. RESULTS Overall, 91.2% of the patients experienced facial nerve function reactivation. Facial recovery began within 2-12 months (mean 6.3 months) with the restoration of facial symmetry at rest. According to the modified House-Brackmann grading scale, 5.9% of the patients had Grade I function, 61.8% Grade II, 20.6% Grade III, 2.9% Grade V, and 8.8% Grade VI. The morbidity rate was low; none of the patients could feel the loss of masseteric nerve function. There were only a few complications, including 1 case of postoperative bleeding (2.9%) and 2 local infections (5.9%), and a few patients complained about partial loss of sensitivity of the earlobe or a small area of the ankle and foot, depending on whether great auricular or sural nerves were harvested.

29283938,Pub-med,Immediate Hypoglossal-Facial Anastomosis in Patients With Facial Interruption,"Hypoglossal-facial anastomosis provides excellent motor supply to the mimetic muscles of the face when there is no chance of recovery of the damaged facial nerve. However, to achieve optimal results, the timing of facial nerve surgery based on electrophysiological testing and clinical evaluation requires close follow-up of the patient. Functional results after delayed surgery are not predictable and depend on the number of surviving fibers, type of injury, severity of damage, degree of infiltration of inflammatory cells, and local fibrosis. Facial hypertonia, synkinesis, and involuntary mass movement are the major problems of delayed reanimation of the facial nerve. Surgery in the vicinity of the facial nerve always aims to preserve neural integrity. However, immediate facial nerve grafting is sometimes required.

29381636,Pub-med,The Distal Stump of the Intramuscular Motor Branch of the Obturator Nerve Is Useful for the Reconstruction of Long-Standing Facial Paralysis Using a Double-Powered Free Gracilis Muscle Flap Transfer,"Background: Double innervation of the transferred muscle with the contralateral facial nerve and the ipsilateral masseteric nerve has recently been reported by some authors. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of our procedure of double innervation of free gracilis muscle for reconstruction of long-standing facial palsy. Patients and methods: In our department, 6 cases of long-standing facial paralysis (4 cases of complete palsy and 2 of incomplete palsy) were reconstructed using a free gracilis muscle double innervated with the masseteric and contralateral facial nerves. The patient age ranged from 37 to 79 years (average 56.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 15.7). In our procedure, the intramuscular motor branch of the transferred muscle was identified and sutured to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve in an end-to-end fashion, and the obturator nerve of the transferred muscle was sutured to the cross-facial nerve graft, which was coapted with the contralateral facial nerve by end-to-end suturing. Results: All patients were followed up for >18 months and recovered their smiling function. The voluntary movement of the transferred muscle with teeth clenching was observed at approximately 4.7 months, and this movement combined with contralateral mouth angle elevation was observed at approximately 9.5 months after the surgery. Conclusions: Our experience suggests that the distal stump of the intramuscular motor branch of the obturator nerve may be useful for facial reanimation via double-powered free gracilis muscle flap transfer.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,1,3,1,9,8,2,0,6,5,10,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:cross-facial,masseteric nerve",,"Tools:EMG, Photoshop Outcomes: smile production, innervation, mouth angle movement",,,,Double innervation,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed the. Results: of masseter nerve-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer in established facial palsy patients. Methods: Ten patients with facial palsy who received treatment from January 2015 to January 2017 were enrolled in this study. Three patients received masseter nerve-only free gracilis transfer, and seven received double-innervated free gracilis transfer (masseter nerve and a cross-face nerve graft). Patients were evaluated using the Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation software (FACEgram) to quantify oral commissure excursion and symmetry at rest and when smiling after muscle transfer. Results: The mean time between surgery and initial movement was roughly 167.7 days. A statistically significant increase in excursion at rest and when smiling was seen after muscle transfer. There was a significant increase in the distance of oral commissure excursion at rest and when smiling. A statistically significant increase was observed in symmetry when smiling. Terzis' functional and aesthetic grading scores showed significant improvements postoperatively.

30949826,Embase,Reconstruction of complex defects of the extracranial facial nerve: technique of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫the trifurcation approach‚Äö√Ñ√π,"Purpose: Reconstruction of complex defects of facial nerve (FN) after extensive cancer surgery requires individualized solutions. We describe the trifurcation technique as a modification of the combined approach on example of two patients with locally advanced parotid cancer. Methods: Due to perineural invasion, extensive resection of the FN from the mastoid segment to the peripheral branches was required. For reanimation of the upper face, a complex cervical plexus graft was sutured end-to-end to the mastoid segment of the FN trunk. The branches of the graft enabled reanimation of three peripheral temporal and zygomatic branches. The mandibular branch was sutured end-to-side to the hypoglossal nerve (hypoglossal‚Äö√Ñ√¨facial nerve transfer, HFNT). Additionally, the buccal branch was independently reanimated with ansa cervicalis. Results: Facial reanimation was successful in both patients. Good resting tone and voluntary movement were achieved with a mild degree of synkinesis after 13¬¨‚Ä†months. Patient 1 showed the Sunnybrook (SB) composite score 69 [76 (voluntary movement score) ‚Äö√†√≠ 0 (resting symmetry score) ‚Äö√†√≠ 7 (synkinesis score)]. In patient 2, the SB composite score was 76 (80 ‚Äö√†√≠ 0 ‚Äö√†√≠ 4, respectively). Conclusions: In this trifurcation approach, cervical cutaneous plexus provides a long complex nerve graft, which allows bridging the gap between proximal FN stump and several peripheral branches without great expenditure. In combination with the HFNT and ansa cervicalis transfer, this procedure enables the facial reanimation with low grade of synkinesis.",6,Hypoglossal + Ansa cervicalis + Cervical plexus,0,2,9,9,8,3,0,2,13,,,,,,,"Multiple nerve grafts:hypoglossal,ansa cervicalis",,"sunnybrook score

There has not been direct comparison or consensus. Here, the authors compare our experience with respect to muscle activity, symmetry, and excursion. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of patients with facial palsy who had CFNG-FGMT or LTM from 2008 to 2016 at a single institution. Postoperative surface EMG was recorded at maximum open smile. Normal and paralyzed sides of the face were analyzed with Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation software. Commissure excursion and symmetry was assessed. Results: Six patients with LTM and 10 with CFNG-FGMT met inclusion criteria. Muscle activity was 1st identified in LTM patients after 3 months (47.42 mV, P < 0.001) and CFNG-FGMT patients after 3 months (28.30 mV, P < 0.001) compared to immediate postoperative period. Relative to preoperative excursion, there was significant increase of 3.33 mm in commissure excursion seen at the 0 to 3 month period for LTM patients (P = 0.04). Commisure excursion for CFNG-FGMT was seen later, in the 3- to 6-month postoperative period (4.01, P = 0.024). During smile, CFNG-FGMT patients had better symmetry than unilateral LTM patients. In bilateral LTM patients, there was no significant change in symmetry. Conclusion: Dynamic facial animation improved in both surgical groups. The LTM demonstrates a faster rate of muscle recruitment compared to CFNG-FGMT. After 3 months, both LTM and CFNG-FGMT groups had comparable excursions.

A new nerve coaptation strategy is presented herein. We performed a 1-stage double-powered free gracilis muscle flap transfer in a patient with long-standing facial paralysis by splitting the obturator nerve and anastomosing the 2 free ends to the contralateral facial nerve (through a sural graft) and to the masseteric nerve. Voluntary movement of the transferred muscle with teeth clenching was observed at 6 months after the operation and a symmetric smile with bilateral elevation of the mouth angle at 10 months.

In this study, we compared CFNG- and double-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT) for facial palsy reconstruction.A total of 49 patients with facial palsy who underwent facial reanimation surgery from August 2013 to January 2017 were enrolled. The CFNG group (18 patients) underwent 2-stage CFNG innervation, whereas the double-innervated FGMT group (31 patients) underwent dual coaptation with end-to-end masseter nerve and end-to-side CFNG. The FACEgram software was used for evaluating smile excursion, symmetry index, spontaneous smile occurrence, Terzis' score including palsy pathogenesis, and clinical progress.In the CFNG group, the smile excursion at rest increased (P = 0.000); however, there was increased smile excursion both at rest and during smiling in the double-innervated FMGT group (rest P = 0.002, smile P = 0.028). Improvement of the symmetry index was observed only in the FMGT group (rest P = 0.001, smile P = 0.000). There was no significant difference in Terzis' scores. The average time to the first visible muscle contracture was statistically significantly shorter in the double-innervated FGMT group (P = 0.035). With respect to spontaneous smile achievement, the double-innervated FGMT group (25.8%) showed a satisfactory outcome.Cross-face nerve graft-innervated FGMT improved only smile excursion at rest, whereas double-innervated FGMT provided improvement in both the resting and smiling postures.

However, some patients report unsatisfactory outcomes, such as difficulty in maintaining resting or smiling symmetry, due to persistent flaccid facial palsy. Here we evaluated the functional outcomes of transferring the masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve to the facial nerve adjunct to facial nerve graft. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of seven patients who underwent facial reanimation surgery between 2014 and 2016. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of facial reanimation surgery: group A, masseteric nerve innervation with interposition graft; group B, interposition graft only. The postoperative resting symmetry and dynamic movement were compared. Results: Facial contraction was first observed in group A at 4 months and in group B at 7.3 months. Most of the patients achieved reliable resting symmetry; however, one patient in group B exhibited unsatisfactory facial weakness on the affected side. Group A patients showed better dynamic movement than group B patients. Eye closure, oral excursion and oral continence were better in group A than in group B patients. Smile symmetry in both groups was similar due to hyperkinetic movement in group A patients and flaccidity in group B patients.

32158663,Pub-med,Masseteric-Facial Nerve Anastomosis: Surgical Techniques and Outcomes-A Pilot Indian study,"Masseteric-facial anastomosis has gained popularity in recent days compared to the facial-hypoglossal anastomosis. Masseteric nerve has numerous advantages like its proximity to the facial nerve, stronger motor impulse, its reliability, low morbidity in harvesting and sacrificing the nerve and faster re-innervation that is achievable in most patients. The present case series demonstrate the surgical technique and the effectiveness of the masseteric nerve as donor for early facial reanimation. Between January 2017 and February 2019, 6 patients (2 male, 4 female) with iatrogenic unilateral complete facial paralysis (grade VI, House Brackmann scale) who underwent masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis were included in the study. The time interval between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 4 to 18 months (mean 8.5 months). In all patients pre-operative electromyography had facial mimetic muscle fibrillation potentials. All patients underwent end to end anastomosis except for one patient where greater auricular interposition graft was used. In all cases, the facial muscles showed earliest sign of recovery at 2-5 months. These movements were first noticed on the cheek musculature when the patients activated their masseter muscle. Eye movements started appearing at 6-9 months (in 3 cases) and forehead movements at 18 months (in 1 case). According to the modified House-Brackmann grading scale, one patient had Grade I function, two patients had Grade II function, and three had Grade V function. There was no morbidity except one patient who underwent interposition graft had numbness in the ear lobule. None of the patients could feel the loss of masseteric nerve function.

32334999,Pub-med,One-stage free transfer of latissimus dorsi-serratus anterior combined muscle flap with dual innervation for smile reanimation in established facial paralysis,"Microneurovascular free muscle transfer is the gold-standard surgical procedure for the reanimation of established facial paralysis. However, the innervation of the transferred muscle by the contralateral facial nerve is usually insufficient to produce a stable smile. Besides, the corner of the mouth sometimes moves unnaturally as if it were being pulled up because of the single-direction movement. Thus, we propose one-stage facial reanimation using free latissimus dorsi (LD)-serratus anterior (SA) combined muscle flap transfer with dual innervation. The LD-SA combined muscle flap was harvested with the thoracodorsal artery and vein as common vessels to move the corner of the mouth bidirectionally for natural smiling. The LD muscle was located in the same direction as the zygomaticus major muscle and reinnervated by dual innervation. The contralateral facial nerve was coapted with the thoracodorsal nerve, and the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve was inserted into the LD muscle by intramuscular neurotization. The 6th or 7th SA muscle was located in the same direction as the risorius muscle and reinnervated by neurorrhaphy of the long thoracic nerve and the thin branch of the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve. Since 2015, seven patients have been treated with this method without complications. On average, SA muscle movement was detected in voluntary biting at 3.1 months, and spontaneous smiling occurred 7.7 months after surgery. All patients developed a spontaneous natural smile. This method for established facial paralysis has the potential to improve the quality of the reconstructed smile and the unstable results of conventional single-innervation-single-muscle transfer.",6,Thoracodorsal + CFNG,0,1,0,9,8,3,0,7,3,8,,,,,,,,"nerve transfer: ""the contralateral facial nerve was coapted with the thoracodorsal nerve, and the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve was inserted into the LD muscle by intramuscular neurotization""

33085134,Pub-med,Facial nerve transfer for facial reanimation with parotidoplasty approach,"Background: Facial paralysis has a profound impact on quality of life in affected individuals, primarily through loss of verbal and nonverbal communication. Common facial nerve reanimation techniques include coaptation to the masseteric or hypoglossal nerve. Most techniques require nerve grafts to achieve a tension-free neurorrhaphy. Our report aims to show a surgical adaption to current facial reanimation procedures using a partial parotidoplasty approach in order to avoid challenges caused by interpositional nerve grafts through primary neurorrhaphy. Patients and methods: The modified surgical approach was performed on four patients, aged 30-67. Length of paralysis ranged from 6 to 13 months. Cause of paralysis included one patient with Bell's palsy in one patient, prior surgery in two patients, and traumatic fracture in the remaining patient. A modified Blair approach is used to expose the parotid capsule. The facial nerve is dissected proximally toward the stylomastoid foramen and distally toward the masseter. The parotid gland substance is sectioned overlying each branch of the facial nerve using ultrasonic dissection or hemostatic scalpel, allowing mobilization of the proximal segment and upper and lower divisions of the facial nerve. The superficial lobe of the parotid is preserved in most cases. The House-Brackmann (H-B) functional scale was used to assess facial nerve function pre- and post-operatively. Results: All patients showed H-B score V or greater prior to reanimation. Follow-up was conducted at 3-, 6-, and 12-months in all patients with resultant improvement of H-B scores of I in three patients and II in the remaining patient. Only one complication was noted, with one patient developing a right postauricular hematoma that was adequately managed without sequelae. All remaining patients experienced an uncomplicated post-operative course. Conclusion: Our modified approach to facial nerve reanimation works well with a planned parotidoplasty allowing for successful reanimation outcomes without the need for interpositional grafting. This technique may be considered in masseteric and hemi-hypoglossal nerve transfers for the reinnervation of facial muscles.",3,,0,1,6,4,2,1,0,4,3,12,,,,,,,,"Tools: HB scores Outcomes: Time to first facial movement, postop hematoma",,,,Hypoglossal nerve transfer,,,,,,,,

The authors present their rationale, surgical technique, and long-term outcomes. Methods: Between August 2012 and March 2016, 11 patients (6 female and 5 male patients) underwent a 2-staged dually innervated gracilis muscle transfer. Patients were evaluated with physical examination and needle electromyography. A standardized assessment of preoperative and postoperative photographs and videos was performed using Terzis' smile functional grading system at 48 months following surgery and the Emotrics software to assess improvement in symmetry over a 36-month postoperative period. Results: Voluntary contraction of the gracilis muscle was observed in all patients at a mean of 4 months and 4 days following muscle transfer. A spontaneous smile produced without teeth clenching was developed in all patients by 18 months postoperatively. Six patients achieved excellent and 5 good results. The difference between the averaged pre- and postoperative scores was statistically significant. With Emotrics, there were significant improvements in the smile angle, upper lip elevation, commissural excursion, and commissural height, with continuous improvement over 36 months. The postoperative electromyography (EMG) confirmed dual innervation of the gracilis muscle by the facial and masseteric donor motor neural sources.

Strong evidence suggesting that vascularized nerve grafts are superior to nonvascularized nerve grafts motivated our team to develop a chimeric scapulodorsal flap combining the usual harvestable local tissues with the vascularized latissimus dorsi motor nerve (SD-LDVxN). We present our experiences developing a new program at University of California, San Diego, highlighting our first case here, and present preliminary retrospective results focusing on the functional outcomes of facial nerve reanimation. Materials and methods: The first case performed in the United States was a 57-year-old woman with stage IVA left parotid adenoid cystic carcinoma and House-Brackmann grade 6 facial palsy. She underwent total parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice and a free chimeric SD-LDVxN flap reconstruction. She had an unremarkable postoperative course, and 3- and 6-month follow-up functional results are reported. Preliminary functional results from our total series of 25 patients were reported. Results: At her 3-month follow-up, she was a House-Brackmann 5 with a static eFACE score of 37, dynamic eFACE score of 31, and smile eFACE score of 48. At her 6-month follow-up, she was a House-Brackmann 5 with a static eFACE score of 50, dynamic eFACE score of 27, and smile eFACE score of 53. Preliminary results from our total series of 25 patients with an average of 5 years of follow-up were a House-Brackmann 2.5 and eFACE scores of 83.1 for static facial symmetry, 67.5 for dynamic facial symmetry, and 77.7 for smile score. Twenty of the 25 patients had postoperative radiotherapy. No local tumor recurrence had been reported. The average reinnervation time was 9 months and ranged from 3 to 15 months. Conclusions: The SD-LDVxN flap is a highly resourceful solution to reconstruct complex parotid defects, especially those that sacrifice the facial nerve.

However, these complex procedures sometimes result in cheek bulkiness owing to the double muscle transfer. We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with long-standing facial paralysis, who underwent two-stage facial reanimation using two superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle innervated by the masseteric and contralateral facial nerves via a sural nerve graft. Each muscle subslip was transferred to the upper lip and oral commissures, which were oriented in different directions. Furthermore, a horizontal fascia lata graft was added at the lower lip to prevent deformities such as lower lip elongation and deviation. Voluntary contraction was noted at roughly 4 months, and a spontaneous smile without biting was noted 8 months postoperatively. At 18 months after surgery, the patient demonstrated a spontaneous symmetrical smile with adequate excursion of the lower lip, upper lip, and oral commissure, without cheek bulkiness. Dual-innervated muscle transfer using two multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle may be a good option for long-standing facial paralysis, as it can achieve a symmetrical smile that can be performed voluntarily and spontaneously.",6,Masseteric + CFNG,2,3,0,9,4,1,0,1,4,,,,,,,"other:serratus anterior muslce, Sural nerve graft",serratus anterior muslce + sural nerve graft,serratus anterior muslce + sural nerve graft,,,,Double innervation,,,"['Serratus anterior muscle flap', 'Fascia flap']",Serratus anterior,Fascia flap,,,

Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Tertiary-care private practice setting. Participants: Patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis of less than 24 months duration. Interventions: Direct end-to-trunk masseteric to facial nerve anastomosis. Outcome measures: Outcome measures included time to first movement, development of synkinesis, and an objective assessment of the resting tone and dynamic movement that was achieved. Results: Patient age at the time of transfer ranged from 6 to 61. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 24 months. No patients had any perioperative complications. No patient experienced significant mass movement or synkinetic facial movement with chewing. No patient had worsened chewing or swallowing. Patients have not yet recovered significant resting tone. All patients achieved smile activity when biting down with a median (interquartile range) oral commissure excursion of 7.57 mm (5.19-9.94 mm), starting 3 to 5 months after transfer. Conclusions: End-to-trunk masseteric to facial nerve transfer is a safe and effective procedure. Patients had rapid reinnervation with good excursion and achieved a natural appearing smile. The rehabilitated smile appears better than that achieved with hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer.

34760845,Pub-med,Two-Stage Dual-Nerve Facial Reanimation: Outcomes and Complications in a Series of Pediatric Patients,"Background: In facial reanimation via microneurovascular muscle transfer, dual-nerve reinnervation of the muscle capitalizes on the synergistic effects of spontaneous motion from cross facial nerve grafting (CFNG) and increased excursion from masseteric nerve transfer. Two-stage approaches that delay masseteric nerve transfer until the time of the muscle flap increase spontaneity by maximizing muscle reinnervation from the CFNG. While this 2-stage, dual-nerve approach has been described in adults, we present a series of pediatric patients who underwent this reconstructive technique. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients who underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction with CFNG and ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfers. Procedures were performed between 2004 and 2016 by 2 surgeons at a single centre. Degree of facial paralysis before and after surgical intervention was measured using House-Brackmann scores. Results: Nine patients with a mean age of 8.6 (range: 5-15 years) years at time of surgery underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction. Average time between CFNG and transfer of the free gracilis with masseteric nerve transfer was 13.3 (SD 2.4) months. Mean follow-up was 27.3 months (SD 25.7). Patients demonstrated initiation of voluntary movement on paralyzed side by 3.6 months (SD 0.6) on average, with 3 patients demonstrating spontaneous movement at 3 months. Conclusion: The 2-stage, dual innervation technique using CFNG and delayed ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfer with a free gracilis is a promising reconstructive option to maximize spontaneous expression in pediatric patients.
